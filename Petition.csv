"CofE attendance is 765,000, representing 1.4% of England's population. The House of Lords has 26 CofE Bishops who participate in debates and vote in divisions, which involve decisions affecting the entire UK. This is wholly disproportionate to the size of the CofE's attendance and thus influence."

"I’m calling for this to be reviewed, contraception is free on the NHS, but a person with a mental disability (depression) is to be charged for having what can’t be prevented. For people who work, prescriptions are chargeable, assuming people can afford it. This is not the case."
The university students are unable to pay for their prescriptions as they can't work because of the full time education.
This year the government decided to change the year 2 SATs tests to tests far beyond what most children of that age can achieve. Teachers were trusted to make judgement on the children they taught. This year that has gone out the window too. Help save childrens education and enjoyment of school.

As most countries with the Euro have economies similar to our own I feel this would help reduce low-skilled immigration while maintaining freedoms for those UK citizens who wish to live and work in Europe. I believe this would represent both sides of the recent referendum vote.
It is vital for jobs and UK prosperity that the UK does not cut off the inportant markets of the EU to UK business after Brexit. Our Financial services are the backbone of our economy and must have full passporting rights going forward. The industrial sector too must not be penalised for Brexit

"The legal age to be provided a smear test is 25, why is this? Because it seems to be that it is ‘rare’ for women to be diagnosed with cervical cancer under the age of 25, but it happens.

I have seen many videos on social media of buses in road accidents. Passengers fly out of their seats. Young children fly out of their seats. I for one will not be taking my child on a bus until they have seat belts fitted. A bus is no different to a car. In fact it's probably worse.
There are many accounts on social media that are impersonating people from victims of crimes to criminals to celebrities and the social media companies and government are doing nothing to deter the individuals setting up the accounts.

Online Pornography is detrimental to young people’s brain. Many research suggests that porn negatively affects the brain so I’m calling for a tax on it as young people often opt for free sites. There is obviously a reason it’s been dubbed ‘the new drug’. Banning probably won’t work but a tax could.

Quota systems simply do not work in mixed fisheries."

Members of parliament in all parties fear the result of a general election too much to table the motion so we, the people, must demand it to see it happen."
Our MPs seem increasingly divorced from the people who elect them. This isn't helped by all parties choosing to parachute non local candidates into constituencies with which they have no links. Making it compulsory to live within the constituency for 5 years before standing would stop this practice
It's very annoying that companies can debt you immediately for purchases but are unable to refund you up to 5 working days. This needs to be changed to immediate.

"Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr could be beheaded at any time. He's accused of a variety of crimes against the state, all stemming from protests he took part in aged 17. His crime is to be a political dissident. We have a relationship with Saudi Arabia and we should use it."

"Despite the DWP making a pledge to provide free calls for ""all major benefit claim lines"" the helpline for the new Universal Credit will be a 0345 number costing callers up to 45p a minute from mobile networks.  This is a disappointing decision and will penalise those most in need of support."

I think the simplest place to start is to keep both horses and cyclists in lower speed limit areas reducing the risk of accidents hopefully.
Currently many patients are charged for television whilst in hospital and for many patients it is costly.  Free radio and television would stop the burden of the cost and the complexity of setting it up.
"Kennels, Pet stores and Home boarders are required to be licenced by the local council but pet sitters and dog walkers are able to trade without any training, experience or governing body allowing anybody to care for peoples pets.

Saving vast amounts of money per person. The carer who provides continuity in care is often forgotten"
Religion is a divisive influence on modern society. Blind faith and superstition is a mentality of the past. Atheism is our only chance for a successful globally united and peaceful future.  The U.K. should take the lead and show the way by not promoting ANY religion at state level.

As Brexit is about building a new future, a return to its navy origins can be considered looking backwards. There should be a choice of colours for people to choose from to represent this new beginning."

"I've seen and spoken to many homeless guys who have turned out to be ex service personnel who in many cases due to no fault of their own are now homeless. Yet a migrant/asylum seaker can be house almost immediately.

Bullying and discrimination within schools needs to be stopped. Let's introduce a social awareness lesson to allow youngsters the freedom of speech and allow them to talk about problems open and freely. Educate our youngsters the benefits of talking about problems and acceptance of other people.

Britain can no longer afford to maintain foreign aid. We send billions abroad when it could be better spent on helping our own citizens. We should stop sending money to countries that have a higher GDP than the UK. 
"Currently France and the UK refuse to recognise the humanitarian disaster occurring on our doorstep as a problem that requires a humanitarian response. In the absence of this declaration, the aid agencies that could provide high quality support - Oxfam, Save the Children etc CANNOT ENTER the jungle."
"A classroom of innocent UK school children is dying every year to an incurable brain cancer called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), but globally over 200,000 children in the last 50 years have lost their lives to this death sentence of an illness. This needs to end & a cure needs to be found"
"The morale of the working staff in the NHS is at an all time low ebb. So it's no surprise that they take little pleasure in going to work, and that enthusiasm is lacking. A committee is needed to balance the difference in wages and working conditions between the different tiers of the hierarchy."
"There’s 12 years until global warming becomes irreversible. Bottles take huge amounts of fossil fuels to make & transport, adding to global warming which is suffocating the earth. Plastic bottles end up in landfill or infiltrating our streets as litter. Why do this when we can use reusable bottles?"

Schools should put parents at the heart of any decision making process concerning RE & RSE. Give parents the right to be actively involved in RE & RSE."
Settlements that include NDAs remain secret. This can perpetuate a culture of bullying and victimisation and allow abuse to remain unchallenged. All NDAs should explicitly say that employees or ex-employees are allowed to talk about any bullying and harassment they might have seen or experienced. 
"Thousands of cats are just disposed of every year without being scanned for a chip after being involved in RTAs. Owners search for months and years and never get closure. Scanning takes two minutes. Cats are a part of a family and deserve to be returned home, not thrown into landfill."
"Since moving into the White House, Mr Trump has shown an impatience bordering on intolerance toward peaceful protests, the media and even the democratic process itself. So his visit to Britain will be an important opportunity to underline the importance of free speech and the right to protest."
I would like the NHS change the way the NHS screen for cancer. I have lost Family members to cancer including my Dad. I myself am living with cancer and it scares me to death for myself and my 7 year old daughter who needs me here to be her mum. I want full screening every year for cancer patients.

"A CCJ on record for 6 years can be the end of normal life for most. 6 months career break alone is dangerous, 6 years is destructive. That Mortgages will be lost, homes break under financial burden, people look to emigrate over a £300 registered debt is ludicrous & the judgements too easily applied."
"Too many businesses in the UK do not have disabled access or even staff that are trained about the equality act and making reasonable adjustments.

Its time the UK took action to make disabled access mandatory in all businesses and for those who fail to be fined by their local authority."
"We the undersigned wish that answering 'yes' to the question ""Were you working in the NHS on 23/06/16?"" means auto-qualification for any future British status."

The amendment of the NHS (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs etc.) Regulations 2004 law to provide GF bread and mixes on prescription is all well and good but what's the point in having this change in law when all CCG's can still choose if they want to prescribe them or not.
"Public Sector workers have been restricted to a 1% annual pay rise for the last five years, a lot of them have had a pay freeze during this time, whilst MPs are exempt  from the restrictions they place on Public Sector workers. MPs should be subject to the same annual pay rises by law."
"The lack of steel industry support in this country from the government is appalling. We built the world, made the best steel which still stands worldwide. Our country stood great, a world leader in the steel industry. Let's ensure its reputation lives on and this country uses british steel"
"Adolescents require increased education around the criminal justice system, and a chance to experience through education just what imprisonment can be like first hand, and as a deterrent from offending. Through hearing personal stories from inmates, prison officers and other professionals."
Steve Bannon is a far-right political figure who poses a direct risk to the security of the UK. He should not be allowed to enter the UK to spread messages of hate.
"A Brit living in South Africa with permanent residency is prevented from voting in South African elections. However, South Africans can move to the UK and after meeting the residency requirements can vote in all UK elections.
This is grossly unjust and needs to be stopped"
"Children today have the capacity to change to future of the earth. Children often do not get to decide what they eat and why, in a moral sense, as they simply eat what their families do and grow up with similar habits and ideologies."
Lack of hospitals and health care centres in Hertfordshire is a major issue as the nearest hospital is 18.5 miles and 36 minuets away this is not including traffic and other altercations.
The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1996 needs to be adapted to include C1 and C1E category after provisional on a background check-points basis so that all the people who were born from 1979 onwards get the same driving possibilities as those who passed their driving test before 1996.
"Food producers must state how much natural and added sugar there is in their products, so we- the consumers can make informed choices when we buy their products. If we are able to find out how much saturated fats products contain why not know how much added sugar there is too?!"
"We, the people of the UK, want to see our Ex-Military persons off the streets. No soldier should be treated with such disrespect."
I believe young children are harder to support than older children and receive very little help.   Currently child benefit is the same through a child's life.   I believe child benefit should be larger when the child is under 4 and then decrease as they get to 5 and when they become a teenager.
Safe Standing and Pyrotechnics at football matches can provide a stunning atmosphere - regulations and dedicated sections can keep this safe
"Following 8 weeks of non-stop Solent travel disruptions. across all three Solent Carries the UK government must explore the options of a Fixed link for the Isle of Wight

The chefs work as hard or maybe even more so it is only fair they get some of the tips. Seeing as most chefs earn a bit less than waiters in most places and work twice as hard at most times.
"Scotland and Wales do not charge for parking at their NHS hospitals.  Why do England charge us to park for essential visits to hospital?
People are being charged extortionate amounts to access healthcare when they have already paid taxes and National Insurance."
"Students need to learn how to manage their bills and buy food on set budgets. This can greatly improve the standards of young people so that they can go into the world and know what to do with their wage and their savings, instead of wasting money."
many people find English to be pointless at GSCE level as many people who take it can already speak fluent English
"A bill has been passed that will allow fracking under our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. Once underway, this will cause damage to scenery, wildlife, increase pollution in these fragile areas and create congestion on country roads. Sign this petition to save our countryside!"
I feel its unfair that hardworking people who pay tax and national insurance which helps fund the nhs have to pay for prescriptions. Whereas people who have no interest in working get this for free. Surely it makes more sense to give workers medicine for free so they can get back to work.
"The public are being mislead on the terminology of what makes an electrician, often employing a Part P company over and approved electrician as they believe Part P is the same as Gas Safe."
"Since the vote to leave the EU there have been multiple figures given in the press over any divorce bill varying between 20 - 100 billion pounds.

"A UTI can be debilitating, testing and treatment at a pharmacy saves women the hassle of waiting for an appointment or call back from the GP for a prescription of antibiotics. It would save the NHS the cost and time of a GP testing and prescribing for a UTI."
"Too often MPs work for the benefit of private industries instead of for the public good. Being an MP should be a privilege, an opportunity to serve. While an MP's salary should not be so low as to exclude people from less well off backgrounds it should not be a subsidy for careerists."
"The Chancellor of the Exchequer is the government’s chief financial minister and as such is responsible for raising revenue through taxation. As a sign of openness, and accountability to the tax payer, the current and future Chancellors must publicly prove the integrity of their own tax affairs."

"People who work full time, pay bills, have no help and have little left per month should be rewarded with a £100 incentive. This would make people working full time feel appreciated. The Government are helping the wrong people and its time for full-time workers to have a reward."

"Khaled Mashaal, the leader of the terror organization Hamas was  invited to London by Tony Blair. He has not gone yet, but we the undersigned insist that he be arrested for war crimes the minute his feet touch British soil. Even Amnesty International said Hamas commited war crimes."
English people surely deserve the same right to decide their future as other countries within the UK. Anything else is discrimination.
"I am a mother of two children. During my 2nd pregnancy I suffered with PND. I felt so alone, and scared, I wasn't screened even though I had said I wasn't well. I received help 14weeks after birth. Now I am better I support mums through their journeys with PND! More needs to be done for mums"
I am a patient with two incurable deteriorating brain conditions. I have waited for six months for three appointments all of which are likely to be cancelled. I have followed the negotiations  closely and have very reluctantly come to the conclusion that the BMA  are being highly irresponsible.
"Charities in the UK should have their charitable status removed if they pay any of their staff more than three times the average wage. Why should a pensioner on less than £150 a week give £5 to a charity that pays a CEO £200k? In 2016-2017 three times the average wage is £82,500. Many get more."
"I believe it's difficult to live on the current UK minimum wage, with the current living costs. If we raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour and reduce the current living costs this would improve health in the UK!"
"Introduce a fixed penalty notice and fine (~£50) for admittances to A&E due to excessive alcohol consumption. Plus an additional charge for unnecessary ambulance call-outs.
This should, in theory, encourage people to consume within their limits and deter from binge drinking and drinking to excess."
"Some ice cream drivers have been abusing their position by grooming and sexually abusing children. Let’s make our children and communities safe. Click the links in “more details” for some articles, google it and you’ll sadly find more. Make it legislation they must pass a DBS check prior to trading."
"Children in Need do fantastic work across the UK. The Government should match the funding made by public donation to double the money available to children’s charities.

"International students are expected to pay university fees far in excess of their British counterparts and therefore pay much more towards improving and maintaining the universities. Sadly, we often turn our backs on these people by refusing their family visas to attend their graduation."
There are proposals to make assisted dying legal in the UK. This is a form of suicide and should not be permitted. It exposes vulnerable people to pressure to end their lives. It weakens the respect for sanctity of life. It suggests some lives are worth more than others. It must stay illegal.
"It's currently too easy for the general public to impulse buy pets many of which end up being sold, rehomed, surrendered to rescues 
The staff in the pet shops generally do not have the right skills or training for each animal.
All too often profit comes before welfare with many pet shops."
"Thousands of miners and police clashed at the Yorkshire coking site in 1984.
Campaigners said officers led by South Yorkshire Police were heavy-handed and manufactured statements."
My 8yrs old son has been screened at his school for Dyslexia&he is classed as severe. The school support my son as much as they can but any specific teaching support for the condition will start when he attends secondary school. This is wrong primary level is when help/support will make a difference
Transgender men should be allowed on their partner's birth certificate as dad when the baby is through artificial insemination or Natural Insemination we are men too!! We have the right to be dads we are not adopted parents we are bringing up the child from birth!
There is evidence that the Chancellor is planning to extend IR35 legislation to the private sector in an attempt to equalise the payments and tax regimes between contractors and permanent employees. Contractors take considerable risk in their financial stability and can be without work for weeks.
The government recognises the loss of a partner or parents and then gives a benefit to those affected but the loss of a child goes unrecognised and there is no financial help after the child dies instead you are no longer mum/dad or carer you are simply nobody with no money and an empty heart.
We have two carers visiting four times a day to help look after a bedbound 88 year old man who has dementia. The patient is very frail and has been visited by carers with cold/flu symptoms on a number of occasions. This is obviously very worrying for the family and is putting the patient at risk.
"In the daily Telegraph Boxing Day was considered “One of Britain’s most Christmassy days for families”. This is not the case for those who work in retail, long hours, little pay, no travel and more importantly VERY LITTLE FAMILY TIME. It really is unnecessary, sale will still be sale on the 27th."
Graduate students who gain a place on a 5-year undergraduate medicine program are not currently entitled to a tuition fee loan from the SLC. This is preventing those from working class and disadvantaged backgrounds from being able to study medicine.
Most jobs now require credit checks. All of us have a past - should we be judged on our credit? does it affect our ability to work?
"One of the greatest minds of his generation.
A national treasure.
Influential for years to come."
"Taxpayers money funded the work of the Chilcot enquiry so why are we now being charged £767 for the findings?  It should be free.  The average wage in the UK is £26,500 which means that an average person would have to spend 43% of their monthly post-tax income to get access.  This is wrong."
"Gambling addictions are often underestimated in their control over individuals and the devastating impacts on the victim, family and friends. Effects of gambling unfortunately can include lost life savings, pensions, subsequent divorces and homelessness among many others."
"NHS and NICE guidelines for prescribing drugs should lead to the highest quality of patient care. Patients deserve access to drugs that can help to either save, extend or improve their lives no matter what the cost. The cost of drugs can be quantified, but how does one quantify the cost of a life?"
In light of the current US administration's withdrawal from the JCPOA the appropriateness of a UK state visit must be reassessed. The actions of Donald Trump threaten both global security and to undermine global cooperation on all fronts. A state visit sends a message of solidarity not condemnation.
"We are an animal sanctuary who rescue pet micro pigs, that have been bought has a pet and kept in unsuitable surroundings. We have rescued pigs from 1 bedroom flats, terraced houses, abandoned in fields and town centers. This as become a national and international problem and needs to be stopped."
"On 23rd June 2016, the U.K. decided to Leave the European Union. Whilst it is down to the government to get the best possible deal for a Post-EU Britain, the public should be allowed to have a vote on the final deal."
"Animal cruelty in the food industry is rife. CCTV access to some slaughterhouses has proven this. As consumers, people both have the right to know how their food was killed and in what region of the country. Children and adults should know exactly where their food comes from and how it was created."
"The NHS is providing inadequate services to FGM survivors, e.g. funding for the award-winning Acton clinic that has helped thousands for nearly a decade is ending. Government must provide funding to ensure services remain and are provided away from hospitals as many fear repercussions and stigma."
"The Queen has never visited Israel during her 65 year reign. Israel is a close ally of the UK and there are numerous family ties. The Royal Family has been invited to visit Israel during 2017, the centenary year of the Balfour Declaration. An official state visit is way overdue."
The Southern Trains series of strikes has left the paying commuter helpless with no resolution in sight. The status quo is not working and it is unfair for the public to suffer and be a pawn in these disputes. Strike action should be illegal and an alternative dispute method sought.
"HMRC, in all their publications as well as communications to individuals refers to us, the body of the Great British tax payer as ""customers"". This is not only misleading, but an outright mockery given the absence of choice over who and what you as a ""customer"" deal with."
The detail released to NHS staff and Unions from NHS Employers was misleading and staff and unions have voted based on the information initially provided. This has resulted in large numbers of staff not receiving a 6% pay increase over 3 years as communicated.
"We have a policy of keeping some immigrants in indefinite detention.  This is unjust as:
A. It can cause mental distress because of uncertainty, immigrants can be kept for longer than 1 year.
B. It can allow inefficiency in processing immigrants.
C. Some detained came to the UK as minors."
In June the UK voters voted to leave the EU; we were told the result would stand but each day pro EU politicians and supporters try to block our democratic voice. I propose we sign this petition to show the will of the people must be carried out no matter what. Teresa May can invoke Article 50
See for example : https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fracking-digging-drilling-paris-agreement-fossil-fuels

"My uncle, Charlie, had a stroke in Cambodia and was on life support. Repatriation to the UK was £105,000. There must be a contingency plan for sick British nationals with no insurance who need to be repatriated. No British citizen should die because they can't afford medical care."
"The ""Junk Mail"" and ""No Callers""  signs are placed on doors by residents in an attempt to stop the need to deal with this menace. But because there is no legal requirement, the wishes of these residents are ignored, and the rights of the residents to not be harassed in their own home are violated."
"Bedfordshire police are proposing zero tolerance on speeding meaning motorists could receive points at only 1 mph over the limit.  Other Police forces are expected to follow

If implemented the number of people banned from driving would rise dramatically resulting escalating costs elsewhere."
"Leaving the EU because a political party used the promise of an in out referendum on our European membership as an electoral bribe was both ethically and morally wrong. 
For this, and many other reasons, I feel that a prolonged period of reflection is needed before Article 50 is invoked."
"This petition suggests a nationwide referendum with the following options: 
No new Runways
New Runway at LHR
New Runway at Gatwick
New Runways at both Gatwick and Heathrow.
London airport capacity has been a recurrent and politically sensitive issue."
"All members of Parliament should sit up and take close attention during all debates. That is what they are paid for. They should not slouch in any way or give any indication that they are not giving the debate their full attention. If they do,  dismiss them or make it punishable by a large fine."
"There is no period of grace buying a car to taxing it The DVLA obtain immediate monies
Refund from selling a car takes up to 6 weeks.
You only get the refund from the following full month. That means there is an awful lot of surplus cash sitting somewhere. 
This practice needs to be stopped."
"On 4th September 2015, NHS England made the shocking decision to remove life-extending drug Abraxane®, one of the first new drugs for treatment of pancreatic cancer in 20 years, from the Cancer Drugs Fund. This reduces an already limited choice of treatment options for patients in England."
People are getting evicted from their homes due to not being able to afford their rent / mortgage payments when they have a serious illness such as cancer. Sometimes benefits won't cover the mortgage / rent payments.

"People with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience sensory difficulties. Train operators are failing to provide or enforce, quiet carriages, or other areas free of noise, distraction or bright lights. Passengers with hidden disabilities deserve adjustments too. We demand a statory requirement."
"Councils are refusing to house young mothers in London by stating they have no properties. There are a number of new developments being built but they still insist they cannot house young mothers with young children, instead they are sending them miles away from family/support network."
"In order for the UK to have a true democracy, the interests of the electorate should be at the core of government policy. 
As long a big business and the media fund political parties, the interests of their sponsors and a desire to remain in power, prevents a government from fulfilling its duties."
I struck upon an idea where you could possibly transfer a stakeholder pension into the new lifetime ISA coming soon.  The idea would be to only allow for security against a mortgage.

We want the government to End the council tax for every body and we can have more money in our pockets council tax is unlawful
"Retailers can sell 100 paracetamol in a single transaction, as long as the packets only contain 16 tablets. Some retailers limit it to 2 packets however this is individual store policy. This should become the law, as it will reduce accidental and intentional overdoses, saving lives and NHS money."
"People in Hong Kong who hold the British National (Overseas) passport are British; however, the British government is refusing and avoiding giving these Hong Kongers the right of abode in the United Kingdom nor in any of the British territories. Many of them were forced to become PROC Chinese."

"If you have 2 or more children, your eldest starts university. The student loan they receive is based on YOUR income. The Child Maintenance for your other children goes up as your eldest is not taken into account. So you end up paying considerably more."
Our planet is choking on non bio degradable plastics. We need to act NOW and immediately stop the manufacture and importation of these life threatening products.

"Currently anyone unable to work who is claiming benefits such as ESA needs to undertake a Work Capability Assessment (WCA).
The assessment checks to see what people are able to do and consists of a questionnaire and a predefined assessment.  It does not assess the impact of, e.g; mental health."
Nigerian government officials spend public funds coming to the UK for medical treatments while leaving the healthcare system in Nigeria hugely underfunded and in a dilapidated state. A ban will ensure they focus on funding and developing the healthcare system in Nigeria.
HMRC has delisted thousands of overseas schemes that could previously accept pension transfers from Britain. This is due to the Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme. Which has recently been introduced. Many people started pensions in the UK knowing they would not be retiring in the UK.
Facial masquing in public renders the expensive use of surveilance cameras useless. It is also not in our countrys culture to cover ones face so as not to appear integrated into our society.

Schools have an increasing number of children with severe allergies. There have been at least 2 cases recently of a child dying from anaphylaxis at school. Each school having their own adrenaline auto injectors could contribute to saving a child’s life when they are having an anaphylactic event.
The NHS dental services in England are a shambles. There is no free at the point of delivery service for patients in need of treatment who don't fall into the low earnings category. I am petitioning to make all UK NHS dentistry free at point of delivery giving everyone a chance to access it.

There have been many people who have taken their lives on the Dartford Bridge in the past few years and these cases are still rising. This could be reduced and prevented in most cases by the installation of a raised  and curved barrier along the edges of the bridge to prevent people from climbing.
"All those who voted for Leave, voted to remove any and all control that the EU has over this country. No control over our trade, our laws, our fisheries, our money, our borders or any other control. The British people, who are the sovereign power, have made their choice. You must deliver it."

The recommendations for safe sleep do not include these items and many parents are misinformed in the safety of these."
It would be a colossal mistake for the UK to leave the EU. The Government is floundering in the Brexit negotiations and the country would be poorer in every sense outside of the EU. And It would affect young people's lives greatly and this could become Regrexit.
"Animals are being used by buskers to gain money should be banned!
Animals are being abused, and treated cruelly
Any animal being used for street entertainment should be jailed and dogs siezed"
Phones should not be confiscated because it is the students personal property. Schools have no technical right to be able to take their phones as they have no possession over the property.
I feel that children have very little knowledge about the sacrifices soldiers made for our country and why we should always take time to remember them as a mark of respect. It should become part of the curriculum for history and geography.

"Sexual education often only talks about heterosexual sex and relationships, which often leaves LGBT people feel left out as they cannot relate to the things they're being taught. By including information about sexual/gender identity, this would help people to understand them and not bully them."
Light entertainment and political satire programmes are not currently permitted to show footage from Parliament. This restriction in a democracy seems somewhat backward and should be lifted.

When the data operators records show the dog as stolen, an alert should be made to the individual operating the microchip scanner to alert them to such. Confiscation laws introduced."
A tax should be levied on industry equal to the amount of greenhouse gasses they release over British soil. This should increase every year to encourage them to go green and help the government's efforts in the Paris talks. Emissions below an acceptable level would not be taxed.

Writing lines as a punishment should be made illegal. Its a physical way of teaching children to do things and also causes strain on the hand.  Instead a diffrent approach should be taken. Such as a course like lesson should be delivered and notes should be taken instead.

"The Road Traffic Act 1988 section 185 , 1 (b) defines the majority of van's currently on the road as a ""motor car"".

In some secondary schools in England it states in their gender policy that all transgender students should be allowed to be referred to by their chosen pronouns and name. However this is unfortunately not the case in all schools across England.

Longevity due to better health care leads to a fitter older population. Because of this the 3 years for a renewal of a driving licence for those of 70 or over should also be raised to 5 years. Or allow the first over 70 licence be 5 years and subsequent licences then to be 3 years.

I propose that UK Police Dogs and Horses be given protection that reflects their status if assaulted in the line of duty. This would be similar to the US Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act.
"Social Care in the UK is hugely underfunded. Meanwhile our Overseas Aid budget of 0.7% of GDP (@£12bn) is among the most generous in the world.

Independence makes sense."
"In negotiations with the EU over the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the Government should not compromise on the need to control our own borders and immigration policy. If this means withdrawal from the Customs Union then so be it. The cultural identity of 'us' the British People should be paramount."
Child care is very expensive which means some parents decided to live off one wage and have a stay at home Mum or Dad for their child. I feel that there is not enough financial help from the government for stay at home parents.Sometimes the wage of one isn't enough.

The banned dog breed list is inhumane against the dogs on it. The police can seize a dog if they think it is a Pitbull. So any cross Staffie could be classed as a pitbull in the police's eyes. No dog is aggressive unless the owner makes them. The owners are to blame not the dog.

"I believe the original ban on handguns in the UK in the 1990s was undemocratic and disproportionate, then Tony Blair's government went further to ban .22 handguns for no good justifiable reason at all. I believe ownership of these firearms is not a concern for public safety, nor was it ever. "

"If for example ""Bio 1mo"" or ""Bio 600yr"" had to be printed or stamped on consumables by law.  Making consumers see how long their item will take to biodegrade may make ppl think twice. Biodegradable is a misinterpreted word, by stating actual time scales consumers can make an informed decision."
At the moment the rules for receiving Carer's Allowance states that you cannot earn more than £110 per week. If the government changed the rules to specify someone in receipt of CA can only work a certain number of hours instead it would be a lot more fair.

Government have promised to give Housing Association (HA) tenants Right to Buy a year ago. It is only fair HA tenants get equal rights as Council tenants. In my few that promise was the most vote wining promises in the Government manifesto. They owe it to the 2.5 million HA tenants to fulfill it now

"During the Boer War (South African War 1899-1902) 46,000 South African civilians died in concentration camps. This matter has recently been trivialised by a British politician and needs careful examination and an acknowledgement of culpability and an apology by the British Government."
"Currently the UK spends £12 billion, all of which it has to borrow, on overseas aid. As a percentage of GDP this is four times that of the USA which is the largest aid giver in the world. In effect the UK is adding to its debt each year that it carries on this ludicrous policy."
"More than 68,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the subsequent Indian military crackdown in Indian administered Kashmir.

"Cameron says that the Tax credits cuts is part of a package deal, citing that the increased 'living wage' and more personal allowance for taxes helps to soften the blow of the cut. 

However, under 25s are being excluded from the increase - so where is our part of the bargain?"

The number of hate crime incidences against disabled people are increasing. This is fuelled by sharing disparaging social media content. Disabled children often don't have a voice to defend themselves so should have special protection against behaviour which feeds dangerous negative attitudes.

"My Swedish wife has been here for 36 years and is barred from voting in GEs and referenda. This is an affront to any acceptable standard of democracy. She works and pays taxes here, and has had a National Insurance Number for many years. Sign if you can see that this is deeply undemocratic."
"Hampshire and Isle of Wight Sustainability and Transformation Plan [HIOW STP] has been published. The plan is to reduce overall running costs in the area. But we might lose 300 hospital beds. Acutely ill Isle of Wight patients need inpatient facilities near to home, not ""ferried to the mainland""."
"Under current regulations mental health conditions such as agoraphobia, anxiety and panic disorder are not accepted as valid reasons for needing a Blue Badge.
These conditions can be equally and sometimes more debilitating than a physical disability and it is discriminatory to exclude them."

"Chickenpox is pretty much unheard of in the USA, Japan and Germany. A vaccination was approved in 1995 and has been used for 20 years. It  was combined with the MMR vaccine creating an MMRV vaccine in 2005. The World Health Organisation includes it as one of children's vital immunisations."
My son's school bus has been involved in 2 collisions in the space of 10 months.  On both occasions the school bus had no seat belts.  We want the law changed before there is a serious injury or death.  Allowing local councils to determine the transport specification leaves children at risk.

This means it's not too late!
This is an absolute disgrace to both privacy and freedom and needs to stop!"
"The people of the UK hear about cuts to public services they rely on but also about the financial slight of hand performed with MP's expenses.

Call it an austerity measure."

"All state schools (even without religious designation) in the UK are required under a 1944 Act to hold a compulsory daily act of worship of Christian character, which is not just archaic, but outright discriminatory.

We would like to see religious education to be objective and educational"

Thousands of young people suffering from mental health issues get taken out of Children and Adoloscent Mental Health Services and put into Adult Services and Adult Wards getting treated with people twice their age. This is wrong and not good for recovery or economically viable.
"Restricting a 16 year old to a 50cc, which by law can only go 30mph is dangerous, when you think that most roads they ride on are faster than 30mph. An example of this issue is a country road, where the speed limit is 60mph, so that's a 30mph difference."
"How can an industry that deals with the most valuable asset that their customers own, not be regulated by licensing as other industries are?

Complaints against estate agents are up 32% with a record £800,000 being paid out in compensation to home buyers, sellers and tenants (Oct 2016, TPOS)."

Smoking warnings are scare stories that may impact people but they are all one sided and only convey the negative aspects of smoking. Why not include the positive aspects of stopping smoking. Short texts documenting the benefits along with the negative could work better than the usual scare stories.
The UK government should issue unequivocal support for providing accurate 'Country of Origin' information to consumers of Israeli products. The information must allow consumers to differentiate between products originating from Israel and those originating from the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

Make student loan repayments tax deductible to improve the affordability of higher education."

"The current health secretary has no medical experience, which is illogical with regards to the responsibility involved in such a job. He is also known to have supported medical practices with no scientific basis. This highlights clear problems with the way in which the health secretary is appointed."
"Our sixteen-year-old son Elliot died three years ago following an operation to correct a broken collar bone.  Addenbrookes spent 18 months investigating and reporting on their own practice.  The report was incomplete, inaccurate and a number of discrepancies were highlighted by the Coroner."
"Stop big Business from running the country. End political ""donations"" and have MP's solely funded by the state so that they cannot be swayed into voting for something that is outside of the common good. This should include transparency of claims. I also call for random drugs testing of ministers."
Drivers bypass the A282 by using the A2 junction roundabout and then the A225 junction when the traffic is bad. This causes severe delays to Dartford residents going about their daily business. Drivers doing this show no consideration to other drivers and they should be fined for using this dodge.
"Newcastle and North Tyneside used to belong to the historic county of Northumberland. the Local Government Act 1972 created the existence of the Metropolitan county of Tyne & Wear. Tyne and Wear County Council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts are now unitary authorities (self governed)."
"The transport of live animals exported from the UK causes immense suffering. This trade is governed by EU law, not the UK government.

The government should plan legislation to ban the export of live farm animals in favour of a carcass only trade and introduce this as soon as we leave the EU."
HMRC are currently able to open tax enquiries then do little or nothing for years. The taxpayer has no certainty and this can be detrimental to physical and mental health. This seems more prevalent in the build up to the Loan Charge. Long-running inactive enquiries are unfair and should be closed! 
We propose that the government explore all possibilities of gaining further concessions from the EU in order that the UK might remain a member nation. The ramifications of leaving the EU will be devastating for the continent as a whole. All options need to be explored prior to closing the door.

"In 2017 The UN has approved a Treaty which prohibits nations from developing, testing, manufacturing, transferring, possessing, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons, or allowing these to be stationed on their territory. 122 countries were in favour; 69 did not vote, including the UK."
"In Germany I realized how efficient and well maintained the highways were and how advanced the ""Autobahns"" are similar to the ""smart"" motorways we have in the UK. I believe we should have a system in place where in certain areas of the motorway it should have an unrestricted speed limit."
Parliament has become so detached from the real world. We believe that laws need to be in place to stop mps from passing laws on the back of clear lies. We don't want studies that have been done by the government to be ignored as they don't fit the party line.
"The Scottish Government should have responsibility for all rail in Scotland. People are fed up of rail fare increases, delays and cancellations. "
"There are numerous licences premises being run leased and occupied by convicted sex offenders in this country. 
I have been told that this is within the law. 
In my opinion and many others this should not be allowed.

"Plastic pouches are classified as laminated plastic & are not recyclable so they are arguably even worse for the environment than plastic bottles as there is no option but to put them into landfill.  There are many other packaging alternatives for the products using pouches, they should be banned."
"The current system of Family Visit Visas is utterly unfair.

a) When one applies for a Family visit Visa & Visa is refused no right of appeal is given. 
b) Decisions are no longer made at the respective Embassies in the country which avoids the face to face interview."
Cutting taxes would put more money in the pocket of the electorate allowing them to deal with their own cost of living and allow them to make their own choices.
"There is already a Women & Equalities Committee, but it has not yet done any inquiries into issues facing men, such as; 
1* Suicide (three times as high in men) 
2* Male rape (where services for men are insufficient) 
3* Domestic violence against men (misreported as only affecting women)."
"Government legislation must be introduced in order to create a canine DNA database in the UK. This would allow dog mess to be matched to individual dogs using samples of fur or saliva collected by a vet. Then, irresponsible owners could easily be traced and prosecuted under existing laws."
"I think that people in the UK who were 16/17 should be able to vote in referendums. An example of this I think that 16/17 should have been able to vote in the EU referendum and weren't allowed to and leaving the EU will affect those who weren't able to vote in it, me being one of those individuals."
"When the people voted to leave the EU on 26th June 2016 there was no proper debate or understanding about the implications of a decision to leave, either by the people or the government. Now the issues are clearer it is a moral and political duty to put it to the people again."
Our armed forces are underpaid and over worked we think that there minimum pay should be raised not just for regulars but also reserve units aswell
"It is our collective duty of care to solve palm oil destruction by enacting an ecocide law, ending state-sanctioned industrial immunity and corporate impunity. Amend the Rome Statute (not a whole new treaty), the governing document of existing international crimes and Criminal Court (ICC)."
Introducing a tourist tax would increase funds available in the capital for a whole range of issues - from tackling homelessness to improving existing infrastructure.
"Currently the minimum wage for apprentices is £3.70. This means that if an apprentice works 40 hours per week, they will only receive £7,696 a year. This is not enough money to live off and does not provide a big enough incentive for school levers to start work and have a successful career."
"Following the recent vote leave result, a law should be passed preventing the Re-Polling of the same subject for a minimum period of time. I suggest this should be 10 years. 
Once the general public have had their democratic say, this should not be undermined by a second referendum."
Many stores in the UK don’t have disabiled access and unsutiable changing facilities for people with disabilities. I would like the government to introduce legislation that would make it compulsory for all clothing stores to have disabled changing facilities.
"How much money do we need to spend on something we can't help but need? Condoms are free from clinics, why shouldn't sanitary towels and tampons be? It's a disgrace and it needs addressing! We can't keep ignoring it. It's real and it's wrong."
"There are now very few surviving members of the BEF, most of whom must be in their late nineties or over 100 years old.  Service personnel who went to the defence of France between 6 June 1944 and 8 May 1945 are entitled to the award of the Legion d'Honneur by the French state but not so the BEF."
These people dedicate their lives to helping the sick and vulnerable and are often poorly paid . It seems extremely unfair that they should be charged for attending work.

"The introduction of a U.K. national ID card has many benefits and few disadvantages. For example: it would improve security, reduce fraudulent claims to U.K. rights and benefits and make it more difficult to carry out other illegal activity. There are few possible reasons for valid objections."
"This point needs to be put into action because domesticated animals being killed with no justice is no option and should be a criminal offence. When an animal companion is removed it leaves people feeling very alone and broken, looking for justice that currently can’t be served - personal experience"
I'm a working dad of 2 children under 2 year old. Me and my partner can't afford to live together as I don't earn enough to support us and pay private rent.

"There are an increasing number of motorbikes and cars with exhausts that can be heard through double glazing and from over a quarter of a mile away. They disturb sleep, prevent conversation and cause stress. Their only purpose is to draw attention to the vehicle"
"The UK shouldn't be forced to leave the EU on terms nobody voted for. Therefore, Article 50 should be delayed until after the people have had the final say by voting on whether to accept the terms of the deal or to stay in the EU on current terms."
"Commonwealth countries such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia have strong historical ties with our nation. Polls suggest all three countries are favourable to the idea, it would help alleviate concerns about mass immigration from countries with dissonant cultural values by offset."
After the EU referendum I felt powerless to say my opinion because I am too young to vote. However many people at my school have a very large knowledge and definitely would've voted if they had the chance too. The people that these referendums impact the most aren't allowed to put forward their say.
Our beautiful disabled daughter/Sister age 26 died of Pneumonia and we think the care of the ward could of been a lot better if there was a dedicated ward with 1 to 1 care and trained disability nurses!

Diet companies promoting their products on social media are directly influencing young people to purchase harmful products such as ‘appetite suppressants’ - which will ultimately lead them to develop disordered eating."
The government shouldn't be able to enact widely derided and unpopular legislation that the people don't want. We need a system that allows the public to have a voice away from the voting booth at general elections.
"Many major international companies manipulate the cost of doing business in the UK, transferring unrealistically high reported profits to a country of convenience where corporation tax is low. If the average UK worker earns 20k and has outgoings of 19k, he is still taxed on 20k, not his profit of 1k"
"The discretionary Meals on Wheels service is being cut to save money. We cannot allow anymore older or vulnerable people to be victims of spending cuts. The Government must make it statutory to stop those at risk in the community being malnourished, hospitalised, lonely and isolated"

We do not need a 7 day NHS at the expense of losing good doctors to the private sector or overseas or due to an even bigger gap i work life balance. This government was not elected because of their promise of a 7 day NHS. They were elected because there was no one better at the time.

"The DVLA website is only open Monday to Saturday 8am and 6pm to deal with certain issues (for example, telling them when you have bought or sold a vehicle). This is ridiculous. A website should be open 24 hours, seven days a week. There is no reason for it not to be."
Road users & hauliers have been suffering the incompetence of the 'new & improved' northbound Dartford River Crossing for too long.  After the multi million pound improvement works were completed road users have had to bear the brunt of a botched scheme which shows no evidence of improvement.

I'm asking the government to support nurses not having to pay an annual registration fee to the NMC which is very costly . Nurses should be able to register without having to pay any fees .
"It's commonplace for vegetarian options in restaurants to be clearly labelled, but can be rather difficult to determine which options are vegan, and can lead to lengthy research and awkward conversations. I feel it's necessary as vegetarians can eat all vegan food but not vice-versa."
We call for the PM to be able to select those outside Parliament to serve as ministers as they are currently limited to selecting sitting MPs and Lords. In our view this would help ensure that ministers have more experience and knowledge of the department they are responsible for.

The U.K. Government should represent the people of the U.K.  Following the recent referendum both major parties at Westminster have seemingly imploded. Once new party leaders have been found the UK should decide who is right to govern them.
"Ever since 2011 it has been legal for teachers to search through students’ phones without the consent of the student. Students are human as well, and just because we are on school grounds does not mean we should lose our rights - unconsented searches are a complete violation of our rights to privacy"
"Today the Scottish Justice Secretary announced that removal of the legal recourse clause in the VIRA agreement.  This legitimises organising strike action for Prison Officers in Scotland.  The same must now be afforded to Prison Officers in England, Wales and NI by repealing section 127."
The dry dock facilities in Belfast (BDD) are some of the largest in Europe and are under-utilised. They would be ideal for use in the long-term maintenance of the UK's two Aircraft Carriers. Minimal cost modifications would be required for accommodation and workshops. 
In the UK dental treatment is costly even on the NHS. Bad teeth are a significant cause of ill health. The NHS should look carefully at the damage charges do to pensioners health and others on reduced incomes.

Instead the amount of their tax which would have been spent on military and weapons should fund conflict prevention programmes."
I'm calling on the Government to require all insurance companies to fit black boxes to vehicles. This will create cheaper premiums for safer drivers as well as encouraging more people to improve the safety and standard of their driving.

It's annoying for me and other deaf people, that we can't enjoy some TV and DVDs/ blu-rays etc. the same as everyone else because companies can't be bothered to put subtitles on them, especially older, classic films and TV shows. There should always be the option of subtitles."

Having recently been dismissed for having a spent conviction despite the protection under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1979. Under employment law this action is unlawful and would lead to an automatic unfair dismissal if an individual has 2 years service. This action is discrimination.
"The TV Licence is an outdated concept. We now have many choices for subscription based services such as Amazon, BT, Sky, and Virgin Media. Why must we pay money to these as well as the BBC!? The Licence is also NOT means tested. Why should someone on £30,000 a year pay the same as someone on £7000?"
"Broadband is a necessity in today's world and should therefore be accessible to all, much like fresh running water and electricity. Surely if every house was provided with broadband through a nationalised BT Openreach, it would be more cost effective than each person arranging their own."

We call on the UK government to end this inhumane practice by banning all cages for farmed animals. Cages are cruel."
The EU Referendum should never have happened.  The UK is a REPRESENTATIVE democracy ie we select and pay politicians to do the business of Government for us.  A decision so momentous should not have been handed to an electorate unqualified to comprehend the magnitude of the task.
Many animals become extremely distressed by the use of fireworks within home environments. I have animals and the precautionary items available to buy to help reduce stress do not suffice.
"The United Kingdom has a proud and admirable record in animal welfare.  When the RSPCA's forebearer came into existence in 1824, it was the first such body of its kind.  It is shameful that almost two centuries later we still permit the inhumane slaughter of animals based on religious grounds."

These companies who we pay alot of money to should replace all vehicles they chose not to repair."
Many people lose their IDs such as driving license which is difficult and costly to replace.PASS hologram cards supposedly should fix this problem but until this day not every place recognises this type of identification.We need the government to introduce something that would be recognisable fully
"With climate change being placed under the new 'Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy', it shows us that the PM does not take the issue seriously, although its effects are already showing. Protecting the planet is a huge job, that deserves it's own department."

"Many people including myself are required to work most, if not every Sunday, without any additional pay. Considering Sunday hasn't always been a legal trading day and the act was only put in place in 1994, I think it should be a legal requirement that all employees should be paid double on a Sunday."
"It is already clear that, within the current framework, the EU is bound to win.  Article 50 has never been triggered before, and it is manifestly defective in its conceptual structure: the UK should withdraw immediately, and make progress as a Member of the EU, from within."
"The main symptom of CFS is persistent physical and mental fatigue (exhaustion). This doesn't go away with sleep or rest and limits your usual activities.

"For 69 years the NHS has been a shining example to the world of high quality universal and comprehensive healthcare, free at the point of use. 
The introduction of charges to non-EEA citizens will eliminate the NHS as we know it.
Doctors' priority is to treat patients, not to act as border guards."

"On 23rd June 2016, the U.K. voted by majority to leave the EU. In the 2017 General Election, the two main parties promised to leave the single market & customs union and subsequently they received an 80% vote share. Therefore the government must be able to withdraw the U.K. from the Customs Union."
"The UK is believed to be in deforestation (cut down more trees than are planted). This is on top of the UK tree land mass (13%) is far behind other countries, EU (38%), Japan (68%), USA (34%). If every person in the UK were given a tree to plant the UK tree population could dramatically increase"
"A recent study has seen that 80% of teens were not aware their school had an anti-bullying policy. 
100% said they felt it would benefit if the policy was displayed on notice boards around the school. So let’s make it the law to have it displayed and not just on a website!!"

If an owner has to rehome their dog or cat it should be partly their responsibility to notify their microchip provider that the pet has been rehomed and send them the new owners details. Similar to V5 for a car where both the new and old owners have to notify the DVLA. If not a fine can be issued

"Diabetics with a low blood sugar level need to consume glucose to stop progression to unconsciousness and possibly death. A glucose drink can be used, which can cost around £3.80 for a pack of 6.

"Over 50 years ago a law was introduced to protect the UK's birds of prey. Friday 13th of November 2015 saw a High Court judge, Mr Justice Ouseley, open the doors for the possible culling of our native Buzzards that threaten the profits of Pheasant shoots. This can't be allowed to happen."
"I want the NHS to offer more speech therapy on the NHS.  I have been fighting to get my son help for 2 years. We have to pay privately for someone to listen to us.

New laws put in place earlier this year have seemingly made no difference."

Parliament have voted for General Election voting rules to be used in  the EU referendum so immigrants from the Commonwealth, Malta & The Republic of Ireland can vote.

Credit searches for new tenants costs the Estate Agent around £7 a search. Most new tenants have to pay the Estate Agent between £120 and £250 for this. It's hard enough trying to fund a house move without the EA taking a huge chunk. This fee needs capping at no more that £50pp
As the cost of holidays at least double during school breaks many families can't afford to take their children to the sunny beach. Parents are penalised and sometimes even prosecuted for taking their kids to holidays during the school term. This makes schools look like a modern prison for children.

"This last decade's rock-bottom interest rates cost savers at least £100 billion in interest, because banks are quick to raise rates on loans & mortgages after BoE hikes, but are reluctant to offer the same, timely hikes for savings.

"I propose a law that would be called the Posterity Law.  This law would create a rolling oversight agency that would audit the legislation after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 years.  If the original legislators were found to be short-termist then they would be penalised by both loss of liberty and wealth."
"It is in the best interest of the UK to continue to have free trade with Europe, and it is important for our economy to have a smooth transition when leaving the EU. Rejoining EFTA would allow this. It would help to reunite Leave and Remain supporters and reduce the risk of a breakup of the UK."

It has become clear since the referendum result was announced that a significant number of the population do not understand how the democratic process works. This is an issue which a skilfully crafted TV advert will help to address.

Co-appointment of a single expert witness will improve fairness."
"Scotland has an unfair advantage due to the excessive money given to Scotland by the Barnett Formula. They use this to spend in uncontrolled ways, i.e. Free prescriptions and tuition fees.  This is grossly unfair to the people of England and should be stopped with immediate effect."
Sporting a Nazi swastika tattoo is as much a hate crime as speaking such sentiments. They should be made illegal if they are visible and tattoo parlours should be punished under the law by fines and prison sentences.
"To get a license to operate in the UK, all ""gig economy"" types of companies such as Uber, Gett, Deliveroo, etc. would be required to designate a pool of equity (or cash from its sale) to its workers. This would be distributed on a negotiated per mile/hour basis + a 'time on network' + rating policy."
"At Taiji, Japanese boats terrorise wild dolphins  and drive them into killing pens to agony and slow death. A few terrorised dolphins are sold to grotesque Dolphin shows. This sadism is not acceptable: endangered species are already struggling to survive in polluted oceans."

Post Brexit vote we need immediate action from the government as many companies will already be planning to leave the UK. Time is of the essence and we need to halt a mass exodus of  businesses and secure jobs for Britain. In-party politics should take second place to measures such as this.

"CCJs are just sent by normal post. If these are not received or sent to a previous address they are just entered against you. This is completely unfair which if you find out you have one, you then have to pay to get it set aside as you had no chance of defence. This needs to change."
"Nursery workers earn on average £7 an hour and this does not increase much even with experience. This is unfair, nursery practitioners have to undertake rigorous training and complete voluntary placement hours before being qualified and allowed to practice. We deserve a fair wage for our hard work."

"The child maintenance calculations are unfair to the paying parent, due to the method of calculation. I am asking the relevant Secretary of State to review these calculations and to make them fairer to both the paying and receiving parents. 

This should also include a cap in maintenance payable."
"I am a 17-year-old, A-level politics students, I feel educated enough to make a rational decision in the upcoming referendum. The Scottish referendum allowed 16-year-olds to vote as it directly affects their lives; as the EU referendum affects mine."
"We are lucky enough to live in a peaceful, democratic country, where each and every citizen has a say in who runs the country. The importance of taking part in democracy and voting cannot be stressed enough, yet information and education on the importance of voting is minimal."

Increase the National Minimum Wage to a fair and decent level so those at the lower end of the employment ladder don't just have to survive or fight tooth and nail to get by.

If my dog is attacked by another dog then it's owner should pay my vet bills. It should be a criminal offence for them not to give their details. The incident/history should then be reported/recorded to authorities/vets."
It is not unreasonable to expect that all companies who wish to participate in the UK economy should be treated fairly and equally under the tax legislation.  The minimum corporation tax rate based on turnover should be the mechanism to ensure that this happens.
"We hereby petition the government to recognise HS as a serious, disabling and debilitating condition, with the addition of HS as a medical condition on the DWP website."
HM Treasury to change law so that companies pay tax where their customer base is i.e. at the point of contact for their goods or service.

School is supposed to provide people an education so that they be ready for the 'real world'. What is the point when people aren't educated on social justice matters? The lack of education on racial and gender issues leaves a lot of people growing up with narrow-minded and ignorant opinions.
We believe that the UK is a multicultural country and if Donald Trump begins to deport Muslim citizens from US with no terror links this is clearly for racial reasons. If the UK government allows him to enter this suggests that they agree with and support his policies.
These people are running our country and making decisions for us and that needs to be done by people who aren't spending their spare time taking drugs or protentially taking drugs while making decisions which could effect us all.
"Bullying effects many peoples lives, touches many family's & interrupts the personal and academic growth of every child.

"Group 1 carcinogens are know to cause cancer like cigarettes for example.

Most people do not know that group 1 carcinogens are in many common foods.

Cold calling on investments and pensions to members of the public  very often leads to unregulated investments and scams. Banning cold calling would dramatically reduce the number of people falling prey to fraudsters and losing their savings and pensions.
British people pay their taxes towards the NHS. They are having to wait longer and longer on waiting lists due to the service being used by non tax payers who have no right to free treatment. Foreign aid comes out of our taxes so it should be stopped and used for British tax payers.

"The minimum wage for all will rise in April of 2018, but that of under 18s by a lesser amount. Young people between the ages of 16 and 18 may sustain themselves for a variety of reasons, and it is limiting, unnecessary and frankly insulting to be legally paid almost half the wage of our colleagues."
"Consent has been given for brine to be pumped out at Fleetwood.  Pumping will continue for years, whilst they build underground gas storage caverns. Local experts have concerns about the possible effects on our delicate marine ecology and on local livelihoods."

Cuts to the funding have forced many people into poverty and relying on food banks.
We believe the Government should halt the rollout of Universal Credit until the funding is fully restored.
Halt the rollout now!"
"THC psychoactive within 'street weed' has risen to dangerous levels. Unbalanced THC:CBD levels can cause mental health issues for the consumer. Relaxing Hemp Flower ('Cannabis Light') law gives a legal, non-psychoactive alternative whilst also creating a new UK industry from beneficial cannabinoids."
Our film industry is currently a subsidiary of the US film industry. US Film Companies are incentivised by the Government to produce their films in the UK through tax rebates and breaks Instead of financially supporting the US industry the Government needs to financially support it's own
"More than 96 people have been a victim of acid attacks in London alone this year. It’s too easy to purchase the products for making acid. There are currently no age restrictions. When paying for corrosives, it should be made necessary to pay by card which is then traceable."
Due to a change in policy roads can no longer be closed. Unless local communities contract a road traffic management company to close the roads at a cost of thousands of pounds. Government should provide the council or police with extra money for these events to take place. Or these events will STOP
"Sociology enhances a student's understanding of CONTEMPORARY society, just as History provides an appreciation of significant events of the past. Why is one considered more worthy knowledge than the other?
Perhaps the government does not want today's students to understand modern Britain?"
"I have borderline personality disorder and because of a relapse and time in hospital, I had my children removed and placed in care. This was meant to be until I got better but they are still not home despite a return to good health and the children begging to be back. I am now fighting for them"
The 'European Research Group' (ERG) is a closed political group within the government that has been supported by Ministers through their expense claims. The Prime Minister is called upon to refer this to the Independent Advisor on Minister's Interests (IMAI) for investigation and action.
"Leaving the EU is an irrevocable decision, which will have far reaching consequences. Due to this we must only leave if there is a clear mandate from the people, which does not exist at present since 48% voted IN. It is vital that there is a second referendum and that a clear mandate is reached."
"I feel that hospitals are charging people a lot of money for pet care, some people can't afford. I lost my beloved pet who I consider to be my child because of the high costs of treatment."
"Between 2013-15, 4% of men aged 16-59 experienced domestic abuse and around 12000 men were raped. It can be hard for men to access help in these situations. Helpline information is available in ladies bathrooms but is uncommon in gents. We propose a UK-wide poster campaign for men's toilets."
"Parliamentary boundaries define the area where a person votes for their local MP – their parliamentary constituency. A boundary review examines these areas and makes proposals for a new set of boundaries which are fairer and more equal, while also trying to reflect GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS and LOCAL TIES."
Saudia Arabia has openly funded Wahabbism since the 1970s. Wahabbism is the extremist branch of Islam that promotes terrorism and jihad. This government should seriously rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia and garner international support to stop the spreading of this destructive ideology.
Senator Jeane Shaheen recently introduced legislation that would deny entry into the United States to non-citizens who are involved in the persecution of LGBTI people around the world. I believe this is a fantastic idea and believe the UK should have this in place also.
"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has alerted us all to the environmental damage that the humble coffee cup can cause. 
See his war on waste program: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07m8qwz
If legislation was introduced to force the large coffee chains to act then this problem would quickly disappear."
"Agriculture on a whole is an extremely important industry, it is used by everyone across the country, across the globe and it's not just for food! Hopefully, teaching children and young adults correct and factual information will help support UK and worldwide farmers and the industry in the future."
"EU residents, who have lived in the UK for 5 years or more, have the right to get UK citizenship. However many people do not exercise this option for various reasons and, consequently, they do not have the right to vote. Brexit referendum has shown risks deriving from the lack of this voting right"
Women born in the 1950's have been grievously impacted by the change in SPA and have to continue working. Many of these women have earned the full state pension entitlement by making 35+ years of National Insurance contributions. Such women should be exempt from making further NI contributions.
"ECJ rules UK backup power subsidies are illegal.

These subsidies counterproductively give funds to fossil fuel generators."

This petition asks for regulations on the source of palm oil, and restrictions to the % amount allowed in products sold in the UK."
"We call for the UK-wide introduction of a deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans. While Scotland is planning such a scheme, the rest of the country must not fall behind. Given the near-ubiquitous plastic pollution of oceans and land environments, urgent action is required by the whole UK."
"The nations of the UK all have their own anthems with the exception of England, which uses the UK / Royal anthem, God Save the Queen. This is divisive and creates issues when England meets other UK nations at events and fixtures."
"Unpaid and voluntary internships of all lengths must be made illegal. They are exploitative & harm social mobility. Despite the Government's recent efforts, they are still common. It must be made easier for interns to understand their rights, and to report organisations that offer unpaid work."
"Baptised Sikhs are permitted by UK law to carry the ceremonial knife called the Kirpan. Many Kirpans are inherited heirlooms & most historic, antique versions contain ivory handles. We want exemption for Sikhs to be able to carry previously, legally purchased antique Kirpans under the new ivory law."
"My father was neglected in a care home. There is no minimum legal ratio or a requirement on public or private care facilities to employ a minimum number of staff. I have spent 5 years speaking, researching and gleaning information on this matter."
"Regardless of ones politics, bogus financial/figures and claims are put forward.

To restore faith in politics and so people can make an informed decision, all facts/statistics should be from a central source, who verify statistics for use.

Deviation from this should be made an offence."
"My partner was diagnosed with Brugada in July 2015, had numerous tests but was classed as low risk. He begged to be fitted with an ICD and each time was told he didn't need one as he had no history of heart attacks in his family. He died august 2016. Losing my partner has destroyed me and our son."
A cross-party body be set up to radically review the UK Honours system and replace it with one that works according to widely supported criteria and does not reward people for their political allegiances.
"It's unacceptable for our government to do so little to help the single adult homeless. I'd like the state to run a year-round service similar to Crisis at Christmas: a safe bed, food, washing facilities, help for alcohol/drug problems, counselling, and advice to find a more long-term home and work."
"The 4 per cent Child Maintenance Service (CMS) collection fee presents real difficulties, particularly for domestic abuse victims.

For victims, a family-based arrangement is mostly impossible to arrange and using the CMS may be the only safe way for victims of domestic abuse to claim support."
"Women with female-specific pelvic problems such as fibroids, pelvic inflammation and endometriosis may be left in severe pain for months as there is not enough funding to get quick treatment. These conditions despite the awful symptoms, are not considered serious and are massively underfunded."
A large number of MPs appear to have numerous second jobs. My view is that being an MP should be a full time job. If they can find time to do many other jobs then they should be paid pro rata. If they have time to do other jobs then perhaps they shouldn't be an MP.
"We dispute the EU referendum result; due to numbers against and that the Leave Campaign substantially misled the Electorate.  

Both Conservatives and Labour have promised to enforce the vote.  This promise blocks at least 48% of the Electorate from revisiting this issue in elections due (cont)"

We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule that if the remain or leave vote is more than 50.1% based and a turnout of more than  55% there should not be another referendum.
In our politics class we have been debating the crisis of participation and the democratic deficit. We feel that a lack of political participation is caused partly by a lack of political education - so people don't understand how important it is to make their voice heard through voting.
There is no strict law only guidelines relating to CCTV for domestic use to stop a persons CCTV from overlooking other people's property.  This law needs to be made firm in that no domestic CCTV should overlook and protrude into another person's property

"The creation of commecial money from the inflationary act of creating money from debt is responsible for the boom and bust cycles. We need to end the fractional reserve banking where banks are allowed to lend money that they do not have, gaining purchasing power and interest from money they created."
I do not see why the police should be exempt from prosecution for the offense of using a telephone or a 2 way radio whilst driving. They are just as prone to distraction and therefore dangerous driving as the rest of us. Even more so in some cases especially when in pursuit of an offending vehicle.
"We are from NCS and we're supporting Skills for Life, a charity who help people with learning disabilities. Recent changes to our community has caused living with a disability much more difficult as benefits have been cut. Therefore, we would love to help and raise benefits for the disabled."
"In 2018, the last exams of A-Level Creative Writing will run.

We want to show them how academic it really is and show them why it matters."
"The UK and specifically urban inner city areas are blighted by gun crime. Murders, injury shootings and possesssion of Firearms (Section One) are increasing.

"With our constant surrounding of fast food advertisement, who wouldn't succumb to the indulgence? However, with children being the predominant victims, futures may be jeopardised by ill health and a lower quality of life. Therefore, we must address this issue now in order to reinstate healthy living"

"After the EU Referendum held on June 23rd 2016, the public made a democratic decision not to spend £350 million a week on the EU.

To improve safety of passengers vehicle sharing schemes like 'pooling' should be banned as you never know who will be next person sharing vehicle with you. Would you like to share a vehicle with a stranger? Female going home with stanger? Help London being safer place.
"Newly proposed reforms to tax the self-employed – known as Off-Payroll Working - introduces rules that enable firms to classify workers as ‘employed for tax purposes’, without providing them with any employment rights. This is wholly unacceptable."
There is growing evidence that proves it is not just obese people who are suffering the consequences of poor diet - thin people are fat on the inside and eroding from the inside out!!! It is time to take back control / responsibility and take action for a more positive future.
Currently those forced to leave their home due to environmental processes or disasters are classed only as migrants. This means they face huge barriers to finding a new place to live safely. The UK should update the law to help those affected by climate crises.
So many people receive letters from tax credits about overpayments that have to be paid back before it can be disputed. We need to make it compulsory that all evidence and appeals are done before any repayments have to be set up.

Humanity has, over thousands of years, developed this system of trust so that we may live in peace, together.
There are few, seeking to destroy it."
We are wasting Billions of pounds of taxpayers money trying to negotiate in a short space of time. Leaving the EU in March 2019 will allow the UK good time to negotiate more efficiently. The EU will be more eager to accept a deal on our terms having lost a major partner.
In London 11 to 15 year olds currently get free travel. This should be available to all children nationally and the law should be changed to require bus companies to offer free travel to children nationally. This would reduce congestion & pollution as parents would encourage children to use buses.

"Driving and using mobile devices is prevalent amongst road users.  

The current laws reduce safety rather than preventing use. Drivers continue to use their phones in a covert way bringing down their eye level.

In 2016, it's unrealistic to expect drivers won't use a mobile phone while driving."
"In 1997, Tony Blair courageously apologised for Britain's role in the Great Irish Famine. Since then, we have taken steps to doing right where we had done wrong in the past.

"The budget for Foreign Aid spending has increased to £14bn.

We currently calculate child maintenance on the paying parents income before tax based in income they do not have but rather 20-40% less. Many parents are left unable to live and go to lengths such as suicide. Yes pay for your child but it has to be fair. Also children within their home suffer too.
The privatised utility companies run a virtual monopoly with an arcane pricing structure designed to confuse. There was no evidence of significantly more inefficiency when they were previously in public ownership and unlike transport we all rely absolutely on utility companies for our wellbeing.
Just like the blue badge for disabled parking. I am proposing a green badge for parent parking. This badge to be given with the bounty pack on the birth of you child with a 5 year expiry date. This is to ensure parent parking spaces are used for parents. Thank you for your help and support

It's very difficult to guess the difference between the different sizes of sheets sold in Britain. Thousands of wasted person-hours a year could be saved if all sheets were properly labelled so we didn't have to make at least three trips to the airing cupboard every time we wanted to change a bed.
"55,573 members of Bomber Command were killed in WW2 and have never received any official recognition for their sacrifice. It is time this injustice was corrected."
"A vegan label, much like the vegetarian label, will make the job of eating out and buying food much easier for vegans, and people who may be wishing to avoid certain animal products."
So many young people and adults do not get the care that they need for mental health. Young teens have to be inpatients miles away from there family. This is not fair on the families . There is not enough beds for adults. This is not fair on services . Camhs does not have the funding to help .
"On numerous occasions I have tried to purchase tickets to various events, through official channels, only to find that the venue is sold out. However there are an abundance of tickets at inflated prices for sale. Some of these re-sale sites are openly supported by the official ticket sale sites."
"People save hard to have construction work done at there property, only to hire a trades person who stops work half way through a job leaving the home owner with an unfinished property and thousands of pounds out of pocket. This should be considered a criminal offence as county court is no deterrent"
"A person earning up to £46,350 pays basic rate tax (20%). After that the tax increases to 40% for anyone earning between £46,351 and £150,000. I feel it is unfair that a person earning £43,351 per annum should be on the same rate of tax as someone earning more than three times the salary."
"The excitement of Christmas is spoiled by premature marketing in shops, 'papers and TV. We are not killjoys, but tinselled TV ads and festive trees in Malls in early November dwindles our joy well before the event. We propose, under penalty, the first day of marketing for Christmas as 1st of Dec."
"I introduced a motion on a similar topic at a Teachers' Conference last year, which gained much national publicity. Not all schools have a garden but all can do something in aa container or similar. Help can be given by the RHS Campaign for School Gardening and similar campaigns."
Following a transplant patients have to take  anti rejection drugs for the rest of their life without these they would reject the transplanted organ which could result in death or additional cost to the NHS of another transplant. It is not a choice for transplant patients to take it it is a must
This petition is to ask the government to make all licenced bars and clubs which serve alcohol to have breathalysers at hand for patrons to use if in control of a vehicle. This would minimise the risks associated with driving over the drink drive limit and would inturn reduce drink drive fatalities.
"We believe that the Prison Service is woefully underfunded and that perceived cost savings of sub contracting of services to private contractors, such as Sodexo, has undermined the HMPS' objectives of rehabilitation of prisoners to enable them to be returned to society as law abiding citizens"
"Children exposed to pornography at 9, cyber bullying see evidence link. Teenagers committing suicide because of cyber bullying, outrageous! They need constant supervision with the internet! It is far too dangerous and the safety of our children is the most important. It goes beyond parents control."
The winter of 2015/6 has already proven to be one of the windiest and wettest on record. It's surely no coincidence that this has happened after the ridiculous decision of the Met Office to start naming the small winter storms we have become accustomed to. It's time to put an end to this practice.
"Worldwide studies show that the involvement of family, friends & carers helps to reduce suicide. The document, http://bit.ly/1VUKDI5, agreed by all the professional bodies, advocates that unless there are good reasons not to do so, consent should always be sought to involve family, friends & carers."
"Despite the importance of this topic, there has never been a debate in the House of Commons specifically on this question. Parliament's first duty is to always act in what it considers to be the UK's best interest. Hence, that consideration needs to be made and should dictate action."
"I have investigated the new emerging smart motorways across the UK and their use of variable speed limits & legend signs. I believe they are being misused and are causing a nuisance to drivers. The new system does not work, is chaotic & has major fallacies. The law harms innocent drivers."
"It has become a common practice for bookmakers within the UK and that operate in the UK to restrict or close the accounts of successful punters. Everyday, countless accounts are closed because of punters searching out best odds on comparison sites and selecting more winners than losers."
A very close friend was lying unconscious while she lived in sheltered accommodation. She was not checked on which means many elderly people are being left unconscious which may then result in death.
To make the lives of all parents and carers logistically easier and for families to all be able to enjoy school holidays TOGETHER... we need to standardise school holidays so that all UK schools take their holidays at the same time.
By planting trees we are putting back what we took away a natural means of controlling rain water not only will the trees soak up the water the root systems will hold together the soil and make drainage far better. flood defences have been useless we need trees/hedgerows to support the ecosystem.
"Crime at young ages affects everyone in the community. It affects the offender as they should be learning and that is postponed or permanently stopped. It would affect the victim as it would affect any victim mentally. It will also affect the community as a whole, making the area look atrocious."
Energy drinks are full of caffeine - no wonder kids have bad attitudes and are hyped all the time. They're pumped up on caffeine.
"To include a deduction for the value of the UK’s share of funds held by the European Investment bank, EU loans, EU properties, cash and any other EU investments and assets, the total of which will offset any financial payment(s) made to the EU in whatever form as part of our final Brexit agreement."
"To make sure we have more security we need to have a security control at every entrance in UK airports, this way nothing illegal/dangerous would be able to enter the airport in the first place. So every person entering a airport will have to go through security."
Renters are hit with high costs every time they move. It is time to bring an end to expensive letting fees which are already banned in Scotland and which allow letting agents to unfairly 'double charge' both the landlord and the tenant.

"David Cameron has led the stay in the European Union if he loses he therefore has lost the backing of the country, he is tryingt to sell out our sovereignty and our identity.  The ploy to use Obama to tell us how we are better of in Europe when his own country would not water down their sovereignty"
I feel parents are penalised if they cant work together they shouldn't have to pay continual fees in order to have help in receiving the financial assistance for their child. An initial larger one off payment would be better.When deducting fees monthly the kids are losing out long term its not fair.
"There has been 2 knife deaths this weekend. It is frightening that young children/teenagers cannot go out and feel safe. The penalty is not long/harsh enough. I fear for our future generations, my grandchildren and for my own safety. Please change the law. Thank you"
"The Partially Hydrogenated Oil family (PHO's) are a common food additive known to cause high Cholesterol, a condition which can cause stroke and heart attack. They have been banned from food production in several countries including America from 2018 and we are calling for a UK ban."
In todays world people don't just work 9 till 5 and require sleep at various hrs of the day. Police have no powers to intervene before 11pm or after 7am. People have been forced to move and made ill from being forced to put up with music played unacceptably loud within flats.
"The brainchild of Alfred Wainwright, the Coast to Coast is a 192 mile walk from St. Bees to Robin Hood's Bay. Crossing three National Parks it attracts almost 10'000 walkers per year. The crossing of the A19 at Ingleby Arncliffe requires a footbridge directly on route for the safety of the walkers."
"In 2014, statistics show 70,000 missing pets in the UK. Many of these were dogs, and a large percentage are still missing. In April 2016 it will be compulsory to chip dogs. This will only work if checks are made.  We are looking for all vets and wardens to scan dogs, plus random checks on homes."
President Donald Trump should be welcomed to the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government and honour Her Majesty with a State visit and address the houses of Parliament.
Service users have made allegations with no way of proving if a worker is treating them unfairly. It should be a legal requirement for social workers to wear body cameras to establish if this is the case.
"The British Government gives Hundreds of Millions of Pounds in Foreign Aid to the Present Bangladeshi Government every year. 
David Cameron must use this leverage to IMMEDIATELY DEMAND that Mr Motiur Rahman Nizami, a veteran Opposition Politician and the former Industries Minister, is not killed."
"The Home Office is beginning a trial of new fingerprint scanners with West Yorkshire Police. These scanners connect to an app on a police officer's phone, allowing quick checking of the person's fingerprints against criminal and immigration databases. This has not had any parliamentary scrutiny."
"In April 2017, the government made provisions to police bail prior to charge. This meant that people were no longer kept on bail without charge for months and often years. Almost a year down the line we have seen this change give birth to many individuals being released under investigation."
7 days does not give the owner time to come forward. Especially as there are certain legal procedures to follow. There is not enough information of what steps to take. The awaiting reports from vets and Dog wardens does not make the 7 day ruling realistic.
"No person within the UK diagnosed with Cancer should be put into financial difficulties by a large reduction of their income due to Cancer. In some instances, an employer may have a 4 or 8-week full Company sick pay, but after this time, their income drops to the current Statutory Sick Pay."
"There is no support for families with children with extra needs,the diagnosis process is often long and families are left struggling to cope even after asking for help and support there is none given, children are let down by professionals due to lack of knowledge on these conditions and suffering"
"Provide 30 free hours childcare for working parents of ALL 3 year old children from September 2016, and not just for those in the privileged areas picked by the government. Most areas in the Uk will not receive funding until September 2017 but a few areas"
"Every year, despite numerous warnings in the media, there are reports of dogs dying in hot cars or being rescued close to death.  The law on what bystanders and even the police can do is ambiguous and confusing.  We need an obvious and enforceable deterrent to help prevent this recurring problem
."
"During WWII, Her Majesty’s Government forcefully conscripted young men from the former British West African colonies of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Gambia to fight against the Axis powers. It is estimated that the West African colonies supplied over 240,000 soldiers."
"For people with long term disabilities that will not get better

If you have lost limbs, or an invisible disabilities such as Dyspraxia, Autism, or any disability that will never get better. ( There are loads of examples I could mention) You should not have to be reassessed for PIP."
"With the creation of the Health and Social Bill in 2012, the Conservative government included a demand for parity of esteem, meaning mental and physical health services should be treated equally. 
The government has since failed to deliver on its pledge and it is time for them to take action."
"In schools, teachers have complete over-riding control over what children say. If they are falsely accused of doing something which they believe they have not done, or they do not believe they do not deserve a certain punishment, it is labelled as ""talking back."""
"Family Court Orders to automatically state: ""Neither parent should cause intentional Parental Alienation including Psychological Manipulation & Isolation of Parental Responsibilities""

Parental Alienation has huge effects on children IE: Their education, mental, emotional state & causes anxieties."
"The current fee for all estates is £155. The change mean fees on 42% of estates will increase by 2 to 129 times, payable even if the estate passes to spouse or charity. There is no difference in the amount of work to issue a Grant for £100k or £800k and yet the fees will be £3,700 more."
The EU referendum highlighted the damage that can be caused by false & misleading information. We the undersigned propose that an independent panel should be established to report to the public on the validity and accuracy of MPs' public comments.
"In the UK, the worrying thing about using your own embryo (which is biologically yours and your partners DNA) is that the surrogate is the legal guardian and can keep the child once born, if they decide to. I find this a scary thought after struggling to have my own child and considering surrogacy."
"Since 2013 parents can be subject to criminal proceedings for taking their children on holiday during term times.

The current system exploits the law that was passed under the guise of dealing with repeated truancy. It is also indirectly discriminating against families based on class and income."
Resident parents who deny contact between their children and the non-resident parent without due cause should be held accountable. It is a form of psychological child abuse. Justice for the affected children whose resident parents think they can play with their lives.
"On the 25th September Kurdistan (a region of Iraq) held a referendum on becoming an independent nation and autonomous state. After years of persecution, the Kurds voted for independence. Yet the Iraqi government fail to recognise the result and use troops to suppress the call for independence."
"I would like the law to be changed, to require products containing palm oil to carry labels which show whether or not the palm oil has been produced sustainably. We have the leaping bunny for guiding the consumer as to an animal testing free symbol and recycling symbols.

Many deaths on the roads of horses and riders. Recent funeral cortege resulted in the death of a horse and injury to driver and groom.Riders are forced onto the roads to ride. Government always having consults but do nothing.We need action now to protect living road users.
Since the amalgamation of Lincolnshire with East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) waiting times for Ambulances have become increasingly worse for the public of Lincolnshire. This is mainly due to resources being targeted at population centres where its perceived performance targets can be achieved.
"Over the last couple of years there has been a lot of focus on issues affecting women and girls. This is good because when issues are openly discussed attitudes can be changed and solutions found.
There are also many issues facing men and boys which do not often receive the attention they deserve."
"Books are zero rated in UK for VAT because of their cultural and educational value. However, Ebooks (e.g. those delivered to Kindle etc) are not, but are hit by 20% VAT. Given that 'virtual' books do not require  destruction of forests, printing and distribution this is clearly unfair. Zero rate now"
"Like most people in the UK I have been stung by the extortionate and ever rising costs of insurance, insurance companies seem to be able to charge whatever they want as it is a legal requirement for road users to have it."
"I am outraged at the amount of youngsters under the age of 16 commiting suicide due to bullying. Social media is not helping with the growing amount of videos posted of young people being hit/kicked/spat on/humiliated, while being recorded then posted on the Internet for all to see."
Sadly humans are not treated the same as other animals. This is completely wrong and this must be changed. So changing the prison sentence to 10 years will start to give all animals the rights they need.
"This could be at the government's choosing, but could be something like a gun cabinet holding the weapon and one magazine of rounds, or the re-introducion of of a pistol licence, with possibly the option for a concealed carry permit to allow persons to react immediately to terrorist threats."
"Fighting social services on forced adoption, give families a fair say and the options to explore every solution on earth to make changes to keep families together."
Our school term organisation and holidays have been set up to meet the needs of Victorian England and a secular society.  We live in a modern non secular community where in most families both parents work.  School provides a means of allowing parents to work and gives stability to children.
"Public transport should not cause harm to public health. Diesel exhaust is one of the biggest causes of air pollution, which is linked to 40,000 early deaths every year, causing diseases including cancer, dementia, and heart disease. It is time for a healthy alternative energy for public transport."
"Reason 4 Change ask for either a new ‘case by case’ filter system for historical convictions or for the ‘4 year+ sentence equals never spent’ rule to be made 7 years+. Once at least 10 years has passed and no further offences have been committed, there needs to be eligibility for a ‘spent’ status."
Hundreds of thousands of people are being affected by these floods. Some of them on a yearly basis. Dredging the rivers will make a huge difference.
Maternity pay is the same for everyone regardless of their usual earnings. A part time colleague took her full maternity leave as her pay was similar to her usual salary. I feel discriminated as a higher earner as I will need to return to work early as I will lose £1200 per month on maternity pay.
"In the UK, the HFE Act states that all gametes can be stored for up to 10 years, but for medical egg storage and for sperm storage it can be extended to 55 years. Currently, eggs frozen for social reasons cannot be extended for more than the initial 10-year period; it is this we wish to change."
"UK residents love to 'get together' in carparks, parks & public toilets. These sex acts are exhilarating for many, but upsetting & shocking for some. Hence, we must consider the introduction of official dogging sites for safety of the general public & reduced costs / time for the police force."
"The advantages include:
-increased daylight during the afternoon.
-energy saving from lighting being delayed, producing reduced carbon emissions;
-reduced roads accidents

"I,ve been an electrician in construction since i was 16 and constantly hear about many colleagues having very little or, no retirement due to ill health caused by the exposure to chemicals, asbestos etc.  and the physical toll to our bodies, especially joints, due to the nature of our work. Help us."
"I believe that in order to decrease the jump in power, from a 125cc at 17 and 18, to 47bhp at 19, there should be an intermediate cc at 18, therefore I propose that at 18, a 125cc rider should be able to take another test, in order to ride a 250cc motorbike."
"Too many animals are taken on or end up homeless, abused or lost and have no way to trace them due to negligence.. Mandatory chipping of animals should be law. Well you wouldn't buy a car and not register it would you !!"
"Tyler The Creator was banned from the UK for controversial lyrics off his debut album Goblin in 2011. The content was clearly intended as adult humour, hasn't incited violence, and the artist has shown overwhelming growth since the record's release. As such, this ban feels petty and should be lifted"
"Angora rabbits suffer a horrific existence in places such as Chinese angora farms.  Despite claims by certain industries that they use responsibly obtained or 'humane' angora, shocking video coverage has been uncovered.  Please support this petition to ban the product in the UK."
Experts believe a tax of just 7p per regular-sized can of soft drink with added sugar could generate £1 billion per year. We believe this crucial revenue should be ring-fenced to support much needed preventative strategies in the NHS and schools around childhood obesity and diet-related disease.
"We the undersigned have no confidence in the Financial Ombudsman Service.  It has a track record of issuing judgements that are contradictory, illogical and made with hindsight. We call for it to be subject to common law and for all its decisions to be approved by a suitably qualified Judge."
In the 2016 EU Referendum Oxfordshire voted to stay in the EU 70% to 30% but now risk being dragged out of the EU like Scotland and having a vote on the membership is in no way subverting democracy
"In 2001 the government decided to link car tax (VED) to CO2 emissions. In 2002 company car tax also became emissions-based. People were encouraged by such incentives to buy diesel cars, yet owners of even relatively new diesels now face draconian extra taxes, parking surcharges, even effective bans."
"The pharmaceutical industry is vital; it's the industry that produces new medicines. The industry is the biggest cost for the NHS; companies charge £90,000 per breast cancer patient for example. Make the industry public, stop profits being made from illness and reduce the cost of the NHS."
I want this to happen as in the Afghanistan and Iraq war it made areas of the country safe again. This would also help out with the refugee crisis as residents could move back to their homes when they are safe from Islamic State.
There seems to be a marked increase in thefts of tools from trade vehicles. Most of the people affected are self employed so the actual cost to them cannot be quantified. They lose work have to spend money replacing thousands of pounds of tools often accumulated over many years.
"A watercolour began my journey of discovery leading to the heroic acts by the artist Capt. John Hannaford & his colleagues. 350 men were killed defusing, clearing bombs, UXBs, over 50,000 across the UK. Many were killed clearing mines from our beaches. They deserve official recognition."
"We all pay car tax and council tax and yet our roads are left in unsafe and damaged conditions many of witch need ripping up and relaying completely which can cause serious damage to our cars. Having paid the tax, we should not have to pay for any damage to wheels, suspension, track rods, cv joints."
"Buses , taxis for profit and cycles are allowed in bus lanes. Patient transport ambulances sit in traffic so are late for essential appointments such as dialysis. Front line emergency crews waste time that could be spent responding while buses, taxis and cycles use bus lanes for convenience."
"London house prices keep soaring, and only wealthy UK and foreign investors benefit as they buy up the capital, at prices only they can afford. Home owning is unattainable for locals and workers living in the capital, making renting their only option. Again, rents are high and saving to buy is hard."
Men who feel they were born as female but trapped in a mans body should be allowed to carry children too! By transplanting donated uteruses men too can experience a growing human being and have the baby removed by C-Section
"Putting images or warnings about the damage caused to our environment, particularly marine life, by single use plastic bags and packaging will deter people from buying these items and push large producers of such items to use biodegradable alternatives. We cannot let nature suffer our waste anymore."
"The law regarding light reflectors on prams/strollers in the U.K needs to change. Prams/strollers are currently not required by law to have any reflector of any kind, with priority given to style & the safely of the actual pram.
 "
Southern Rail has been giving worse and worse service for years and years! Trains are being delayed and cancelled too frequently and causing major disruption for commuters.  It is time for a new company to be given the franchise or better yet for the government to take control of the rail system.
"Since setting of speed limits was relaxed, local councils have set inappropriate limits on main roads (sometimes across entire boroughs) without proper consultation (typically 20% or less of residents) and not used ""LOCAL KNOWLEDGE"" as suggested in Gov guidance. 20 is NOT PLENTY (in most cases)"
"Britain's Motorways are congested, but this isn't helped by terrible drivers. Slow driving and lane hogging can be worse than speeding. Speeding is policed with signs and fines. Do the same and regularly remind drivers on digital displays and bridges to speed up or keep left. Simple but effective."
"It is a criminal offence for taxis or private hire drivers to refuse to carry guide or assistance dogs, unless they hold an exemption. This petition calls for parity so the same applies to businesses and service providers. We also call for police to be the prosecuting authority via magistrates court"
Women shouldn’t have to worry about taking time off of work for cervical screening. Loosing pay or not having enough holiday entitlement are horrific reasons women do not get screened. Companies should promote cervical screening by offering paid time off for it. This should be government backed.
I am disgusted by the increase in animal abuse reported in the United Kingdom in slaughter houses. From malpractice to sheet cruelty we need to find a way to ensure that these awful people can be punished. this would be a fantastic step forward in step changing animal welfare in this country.
"Stroke advice currently follows FAST - Face, Arms, Speech, Time. Some parts of the brain affected by stroke don't deal with any of those functions, so adding Balance and Eyes to create BEFAST will cover much more."
Too many private landlords do not carry out their legal obligations at the detriment of their tenants. A governing body is required to regulate such requirements and support tenants whom need to report such landlords for not meeting safety & obligatory maintenance and to investigate harrassment
"This area is perfect for renewal energy, wind farms, solar.  Nuclear is totally unnecessary. Renewable energy is the way forward if designed to be used by the UK and not sold off."
"Austerity cuts … reductions we have been told are a measure all in UK will be effected by from the top to bottom but MPs, County Councilors and top civil servants have been left untouched by this, shouldn't their numbers be reduced…cut as other parts of public sector have had and still undertaking"
"This petition urges the government to use CPI (currently at 0.5%) to increase tuition fees instead of the 2.8% forecasted rate from the Office of Budget Responsibility. This rate will benefit students more, whilst also covering the cost of inflation for universities."
"The poor quality of new homes is not new. (NHBC, Barker Review of 2004, Office of Fair Trading Market Study of Home Building in the UK October 2008, and more recently the APPG Inquiry 2016) Yet surprisingly, there has not been any legislation to force this industry to improve."
"When I talk about using images of service men I am including those that have also left the force. 
This has come around after seeing countless upon countless photos of Lee Rigby (RIP) be used without permission from his family causing them distress and they can't do anything about it"
"The chancellor, George Osborne, is planning to keep ""25% of secondary schools open past 15:30"". This is inconsiderate to not only the students but also the staff. Staff unfortunately are already under strain from the current long day which often continues at home for marking and further planning."
"After hearing the awful tragedy of the family who lost their lives as their car went off the pier in Buncrana, it stresses the importance a lifehammer or emergency hammer could have on saving lives. They cost barely anything. They break the glass windows in emergencies allowing people to escape."
"Our nation is getting worse with alcohol and gambling, young children, teens are being exposed to bad influences that it is good to drink alcohol and gamble as it is good to watch sport such as football. Children are seeing this as a norm and have become addicts.
It is time to stop this."
"Over the past 9 years of supporting sick and disabled children and running Matts Mission Children's Charity over 6 years, we sadly come into contact with many families with sick children that have lost hair or are disabled and are bullied in school.

A subject needs to be put in place to support."
The Royal School for Deaf Children Margate was established in 1792 to provide education and residential provision for deaf children.They are a non-maintained day and special school with registered Children's Home for young people who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment or other special needs.
I believe the UK Government should put all the pressure it can to make Trophy Hunting illegal worldwide. If we do not do something magnificent creatures will be lost for future generations. I would also like to be illegal to kill a similar creature in Britain.
the full details are well known to everyone the media has covered it fully
"The Royal Parks serve as the 'lungs' of London - a green refuge where Londoners can go to find fresh air in a city with some of the worst air quality in the UK.  As such, this precious space should be kept smoke-free so that people don't have to dodge second hand smoke as they exercise/relax."
"Ebooks and paid e-literature  (electronic newspaper/magazine subscriptions) carry 20% VAT but paper books, newspapers and magazines are zero rated for VAT. 
In the past we have been told that EU legislation prevents a 0% VAT rate and that e-literature is a 'service'."
We now know we are 12 years away from climate catastrophe. And that the single biggest thing we can do to reduce our impact on the Earth is to eliminate animal products from our diet. Yet any talk of the government encouraging us to adopt a vegan diet is swept aside as ‘nanny-stateism.’
"Mental health problems have a greater impact on people’s ability to work than any other group of disorders. At the moment, we have no mandatory protocol, training or support for people who suffer with Mental Illness and this usually ends in dismissal by a manager or resignation of an employee."
With the recent growth in the local area and large factories opening up at Bardon and the near death of Coalville it's time to reintroduce the line.
"Imagine feeling that there is no hope left in life, nothing to live for. These thoughts go through peoples heads daily and they consequently end their lives. Some people may have no one to talk to, but there are services that can help. I believe putting the information out there will save lives."
"Oswestry MLU it is in danger of becoming a birthing unit. Add your voice to this petition to keep this unit open full time & keep this amazing service,  vital not only for births in Shropshire & Powys but to keep the amazing ante & post natal care so many of us have been lucky enough to receive."
"I’m a crime victim & have experienced the horrific tactics adopted by defence barristers determined to get perpetrators off regardless of guilt. I propose, in the interest of fairness, that both accused & victims can voluntarily submit to lie detector tests & that this evidence can be used at trial."
I would like to propose a once in a generation special public holiday to get everyone outside with recycled bin bags & litter pickers to help clear & tidy up their local areas from the unsightly litter that we all come across from day to day but never have the time to do it.  The UK is beautiful!
"In the small dependent territory, Montserrat, sexual abuse of children (girls and boys) by adult males are not been prosecuted due to either police, or those in authority being too familiar with the offender, or parents of children being paid to keep the crime a secret, thus destroying young lives."
I would like parliment to allow public use of rivers and canals in England and Wales for small manually propelled vessels with a crew of up to 3 persons.
"Since the start of 2018, 18 school shootings have occurred in the USA - averaging to three every week. This is as much a gun control issue as it is a mental health issue. We call upon the government to impose some sanctions upon the US until they DO something to control this devastating situation."
"The Government compounds an injustice, in failing to provide legal parity, by continuing to support immunity and pardons, given to individuals of known Republican terrorist groups, whilst denying their legal representatives, Her Majesty's Forces, in the conflict, the same rights."
"George Osborne has announced that if Britain leaves the EU, he will be forced to raise taxes and cut spending to prevent an economic meltdown. Not only is the 'evidence' used to suggest this just based on wild predictions and scaremongering, but it also contradicts the 2015 conservative manifesto."
"I feel that nervous animals, the elderly and young children suffer when fireworks are set off at all hours on any day. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 1  o clock in the morning last night for example."
"The Armed Forces are increasingly being used to in support of the Civil Authorities for Public Sector Strikes & Emergencies. To allow Armed Forces Personnel to proudly show their service to the community, they should be entitled to the General Service Medal 2008 for official MACA Operations."
Gun crime in the UK is at an all time high. The amount of lives ruined by this crime is wrong. Guns ruin lives. We need guns of our streets and this is the only way to do it. Possesion or association should carry a maximum of a 30 year prison sentence. Guns are currently too easy to purchase.
"The normal rate VAT 20% on takeaway food. It is very high, Most shops are not able to pay the liability and they start cheating the system. Almost all individual owned takeaway shops are hiding their turnover."
"So many people are forced to turn away, close their eyes or even have others to protect them. It also prevents us to do something that normal people can do e.g. concerts. By banning strobes we would be reducing the risks of seizures and enable us to do something that anyone else could do."
The UK has just voted to leave the EU and after Article 50 is triggered we will have to negotiate the terms of our disengagement within two years. Our current government gained a parliamentary majority with just 37% of the vote. It does not have a mandate to carry out these negotiations on its own.
"In Ireland, France and Spain forced adoption is illegal; in Britain, it is not. Why have we got less parental rights?"
"The Government should walk away from the Article 50 negotiations and leave the EU immediately with no deal. The EU looks set to offer us a punishment deal out of spite. Why wait another 18 months when we could leave right away and fully take back control of our country, lawmaking powers and borders?"
"Children's Voices need to be heard, they can no longer sit in silence and be fearful of authority. They need to be able to trust and confide in individuals and not be called liars.
Parents need to stop being gagged. This is draconian, and they should be able to speak about their individual cases."

In most public sector jobs the relevant Cabinet minister has little/no experience actually doing any of the jobs they oversee. It would give them more credibility if they have done the jobs in the sector that they're responsible for. eg.The minister for health should have worked in healthcare.
"As the fur industry grows - worth $40 billion worldwide - the cruelty it funds is becoming clear, and a UK ban gains support. The 'in/out' referendum approaches for the UK, and upon the option of staying in the EU, the proposal to ban the trade and import of fur in the UK should be considered."
"I'm a university student and I want to support all the other students. Maintenance Loans aren't covering living costs at university anymore and it's a day to day struggle for all of us, we are the future of this country. How can we carry this country forward if we always have to worry about money?"
"No one in the UK should be left without access to benefits. Sanctions  lead to further poverty which can include loss of homes and sometimes to death.
Losing benefits is not a proportionate response to missed appointments. No one should be denied access to money.
It is time for sanctions to stop."
"We are sick of the EU sticking their nose in and dictating to us how we can run our country's industries! TATA are having to axe 1,200 jobs as they owe around £15m in taxes, we want the government to give a break on that tax with the condition that it goes towards saving the jobs of their workers!"

As a carer I could start my shift at 7am and finish at 2pm but may only be paid for 4 hours work because the Councils pay care companies for the minutes they are in with a client. If a client cancels their call I won't get paid. I love care work but no one can be expected to work for free.
'Career' politicians do not have experience of our lives in the UK.  The 'workplace' is defined as any job that is not associated with politics.  EG salaried lobbyists and union representatives would not be able to become MPs unless they had also worked in other professions for 15 years.
"Currently Cannabis is in Schedule 1 - meaning that there is no known therapeutic use - Not only is this notion scientifically incorrect, it also puts patients that rely on Cannabis to survive in immediate danger i.e. no regulation/poor quality medicine, criminal activity to acquire medication."
The 'turn-out' at local government elections is abysmal. The resultant problem is that small groups that are motivated by a covert agenda may succeed. A 'fixed penalty' for failing to vote - as applies in Australia & N.Z. - might provide an extra incentive to vote.

"Surely, in this day and age, education is of prime importance. How can we possibly BEGIN to educate when MILLIONS of people believe in things which do not exist?

"Cannabis is widely believed to have broad medical applications, and there is solid evidence to support some of these. We cannot know the true extent without research. It seems obvious that the current restriction is based on ideology rather than evidence, and this stance is academically unacceptable"
"Breck Bednar, 14 was murdered by someone he met online at their first meeting. At the moment the police can only arrest offenders if they meet the children they groom online. This would have been too late for Breck, so it is imperative police are able press charges before children are put in danger."
"Teachers are dealing with children who are coming to school hungry because their families have had their benefits sanctioned. Government is knowingly relying on food banks to fill the gap, when once the state would do this.  Vulnerable families with disabled, children and elderl people are starving."

"The Chair of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said officials must ensure drugs don’t run out if there’s no Brexit deal. The Government is stockpiling medicines. This is not acceptable. Patients with long-term conditions need medication immediately or they could die. "
"Student finance is a joke on the way they assess how much money each student gets. They base it on how much your family earns. But myself and others fend for ourselves, We don't rely on our parents for financial help. Also at the end of our courses, we are the ones paying it back not our parents."
"Please ensure that developing countries do not face the cold shoulder of protectionism so that they are able to trade fairly and freely with us, please do this by unilaterally abolishing customs tariffs against them."
to create a law to make people slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or accidents etc on the roadside...

I am petitioning to end animal captivity and give every animal the freedom it deserves."
"Britain is the 6th richest country on earth, yet 1/3rd of British children live in poverty. 3.8 million Brits in work live in poverty. A majority of people live paycheck to paycheck. The botched rollout of universal credits made matters worse. It's time for parliament to debate the basic income."
"According to analysis of figures published by the Government on Wednesday (16th March) by Sky News, the Government are potentially planning on selling their shares in RBS at a massive £20bn loss to the taxpayer. But we don't have to accept this loss because they don't have to sell."

The Government must commit to following the current process for all drugs already in the EU clinical trial and approval pipeline.
"The decision by the Government to 'ban' applicant/tenant fees is poorly conceived and of little benefit to tenants or the economy of the UK. In addition, this 'ban' goes against the very grain/ideology of a 'free market' economy."
"Change law to allow 16 & 17 year olds a right to vote in the UK and debate a maximum voting age. The referendum highlighted the reality of these issues.

People that will be affected by an election or referendum must be allowed a vote and have a voice, those that will not be affected should not."
I would like to ban people from selling and buying birds as pets and keeping them in cages as I think it is very cruel for them to spend their lifetime in a cage and not being able to fly freely like they should do. Birds are born to fly and don't deserve a life like this...

The system used for the current general elections is unproportional leaving the country with a government which the majority of its people did not vote for; changing to the D'Hondt system will ensure that every person has at least one representative in their region and make elections much fairer.
Currently you are unable to to gain advantage points from supermarkets and reatailers such as boots on formula milk (for under 6 months) you can also not buy formula with these advantage points. This is due to a law that prevents the promotion or discount of formula milk for under 6 month olds.

"The cost of living for the majority of UK citizens is punitive. The lowest band of income tax rate at 20% is unaffordable for many. The tax free bands are too low. Families are homeless and hungry. If companies are to get tax breaks, citizens should too. Reduction in VAT will stimulate the economy."
Stop the debate of legalising cannabis!!!
"There are too many animals being dumped, abandoned and stolen in the UK.  It is deeply upsetting to see horses dumped because they have been neglected, family dogs stolen for baiting in dog fights and the resulting injured dogs.  This can be controlled by enforcing animal owners to obtain a licence."

"People who lived here more than 7 years have a huge social circle. Everyone is connected to each other. Deporting these immigrants will leave a very bad impact on their familes and local community.

The current Sexual Offences Act 2003 is gender-bias as the law only legally recognises sexual offences committed by males as rape. This neglects those (males and females) who have been have been sexually assaulted by females.

Five horses have died too are selfish needs how many more?
"There are vehicle charging points in London and the South and in towns and cities around Europe. If the government is promoting their use and therefore reduced emissions, it is vital that these are available throughout the UK. Charging points in every conurbation would allow for all electric travel."
These schemes are basically a cute novelty dressed up as education and it is totally unacceptable that living creatures are exploited in this way. Especially in this modern era when you can live-stream chicks hatching and there are many city farms and facilities schools could visit.
Many weekends picking up dog poo from Children's football pitches and hearing the excuse from irresponsible dog owners that they have forgotten their bags.  Not enough wardens to catch them in the act so make it an offence not to come prepared and allow spot checks with hefty fines.
An MP is calling for the Queens Sapphire Jubilee to marked with a bank holiday in June 2017. The MP will present his Queen's Sapphire Jubilee to the Commons shortly. This is yet another example of how we as a nation can apparently afford opulent royal events while having to endure austerity.

* It is wrong in principle to reward illegal behaviour.

So let's start with the easy steps - why are millions of blankets on planes wrapped in the stuff?"
"Technology has been developed enough to do things like send humans into space, but we continue to conduct research on animals. It is a breach of The 5 Freedoms (animal equivalent to a human rights act). This is cruel, forced upon the animals and also more expensive long term to look after them."

Julian Assagne has had to seek refugee in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Now that the UN has said that Assange has been declared to be in arbitrary detention. I call on the UK government and MP's to pass an Act of Parliament to protect him from deportation and thus grant him asylum in the UK.
"Every petition that has passed muster on this site in the past has been given no more than lip service by the government, who arrogantly reject the public's concerns each and every time.  It's time for this to change, and for worthwhile motions to be accorded the respect and attention they deserve."
"In the U.K., we recognise Remembrance Sunday to mourn those killed in the first and second world wars and other conflicts worldwide. Why do we not apply the same reverence and respect to people enslaved around the world today, and generations previously?"

The UK Government has a target to recycle 50% of all household waste by 2020.  A recent report showed that we recycled less in 2016-17 than in 2011-12.  Is there any wonder that the general public is recycling less when local borough councils are imposing charges on residents for replacement bins.
"The school my children attend is regularly closed to allow the local council to use it as a polling station. It is not acceptable to allow this to continue happening.

"To allow consumers to make an informed choice, I believe that batteries should contain charge capacity information.

For example '2000 mAh' (rather than 'High' which is meaningless) & also carry an expiry date.

Manufacturers could then be penalised for selling substandard merchandise."

Housing benefit is often not covering the cost of renting even a room. In some rent has gone up from £300 - £400 4 years ago to nearly £1000 p/m. Increasingly, people can afford to stay in a place unless they share a room with another tenant."

Due to the current governing body for midwifery (The NMC)stating that current independent midwifery practice indemnity insurance is not sufficient we are asking for the government to introduce different regulations that will provide adequate indemnity insurance for independent midwives.
Given the major complaint during the EU referendum was one of factual inaccuracies there should be a way to hold newspapers to account without limiting freedom of the press. If a lie is told on the front page the apology/correction should also be on the front page thus making them more accountable.

"The law states that one punch assaults are sentenced to GBH which is up to 5yrs but usually get 2.5yrs. 
Manslaughter which is up to 10yrs but get 3 to 5yrs.

Britain has shown itself to be a nation that unites when it comes to sport. In these somewhat divided times a post-Brexit United Kingdom will need to find ways to unite us all and demonstrate that we are outward facing nation. What better way that a joint bid to host the football World Cup?
The Health Secretary has misrepresented data to claim a non-existent weekend mortality effect. The Public Accounts committee says his 7-day NHS plan is unfunded. His proposed contract has alienated a generation of doctors. We demand an Independent Inquiry into Hunt's actions and their consequences.

A major reform of the whips system is essential to bring back meaningful debate to parliament.  The power of the whips inhibits democracy and encourages a herd instinct and mindlessly partisan behaviour. The power Whips currently hold encourages a lack of integrity and independent thought.

"The super-rich can put limitless assets into trusts so that their beneficiaries pay only a fraction of the taxes they would otherwise owe.  We've seen this recently with the 7th Duke of Westminster, who will avoid paying £3.6 billion inheritance tax.  A £40 million cap would stop this."
Student nurses don't get enough money to cover childcare costs. The 30 hours funding is only available to people who earn 120pw but it is not fair that student nurses have to work 37.5 hours at placement then work 2 days to meet this criteria

Too many people are killed or seriously injured on UK roads.  Around 95% of incidents are caused by human error; what a driver does or fails to do.  Cameras would make drivers more responsible for their actions and save a lot of time investigating incidents.  Dashcam evidence could be conclusive

Reading way too many tragic stories of women under 25 dying of cervical cancer. Smear tests should be a legal requirement from the age of 16. Too many young women are in danger and this needs to stop. It's so upsetting to read for us all and can easily be changed by the government moving the age.

Banning the Internet for these offenders restricts re offending."

Children who suffer abuse are affected in the worst way possible. They don't get to do a sentence then it's all over, they are sentenced to life!"
"Under UK law death by dangerous driving has a maximum gaol sentence of 14 years (CPS website) 
We the undersigned think this maximum tariff should be removed and a sentence of ""Life"" introduced (as if death was caused by any other way) 
This is especially true when driver is disqualified or unfit"
"I am shocked by the number of people still using their mobile phones while driving, especially those who drive for a living. The current punishments for using your phone while driving are clearly not harsh enough. Perhaps an automatic ban of 2 months would deter people."

Upgrade the A2 to a full licence after 2 years. 
Car drivers can drive a vehicle with any power after one test, why can't us bikers?

Gas stunning is a cruel method of killing animals. A video on YouTube made me aware of this horrid way animals are killed everyday. It should be made illegal.
The EU referendum result has left the current government with no backup plan. This petition therefore asks for a General Election to be called so that the parties can set out their positions with regard to EU negotiations. The new government can then go forward with a new mandate and clear plans.

I want the government to stop charging food businesses 20% VAT. The reason for this is because our industry has barely any VAT to claim back and yet we get charged that 20% on our turnover which is unfair compared to other industries. This ruins cash flow and causes business owners financial issues.

"There is a lack of deterrent for dangerous drivers on UK roads. Speeding, illegal manoeuvring and blatant disregard for the Highway Code seem to have become common-place. The UK needs to rethink it's reliance on speed cameras, speed humps, etc. and begin enforcing speed and dangerous driving laws."
Internet based companies have an unfair competitive advantage over traditional bricks and mortar retailers who have to pay business rates.  This disproportionate cost is contributing towards the demise and failure of the local high street.   Help redress the imbalance for all retailers.

It is becoming obvious that it is only fair to allow existing migrants to stay provided they are contributing but this must NOT include new migrants since Brexit has been decided upon.  The Government must insist that all subsequent visitors/migrants have passports with biometric information within.
The future of Soho could change dramatically this coming June when we anticipate the transport minister announcing the approval of CrossRail 2. It will allow the demolition of two blocks for a new train station that will bring double the footfall of Kings Cross Underground into and around Soho.

There are thousands of HGV/LGV drivers who on a daily basis are denied access to toilet and washing facilities at some major distribution centres in the U.K. despite the fact that they could be stuck there for a number of hours. I believe that this contravenes our human rights and should be illegal

The choice of voting for the constituency a Serving Member (and his/her family) find themselves in (when based in the UK) or voting for a constituency they had lived in previously is often unsatisfactory.  In my experience serving members don't vote at all and few use their MP.

"As an Early Years Practitioner, I have noticed how little the “Traffic Light System” is put on the children’s foods.

The law against animal abuse needs changing. We need a animal abuse register to stop people from owning pets when they have previously abused one. It should state who they are and what they did.

b. Section 13"

"It is a criminal offence in England and Wales to cycle on footways such as pavements, walkways and foot bridges. The current penalty for this is a measly £50 fine despite the danger to pedestrians.

"Public Health England run a national screening programme for men aged ≥65 to detect abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). If left undetected, a AAA rupture is fatal in 90% of cases. The condition is not unique to men, women also suffer and die from AAA ruptures. So why aren't women also screened?"
"Freelancers make up 15% of the UK workforce, yet there has been little change in legislation to support this shift. In particular the lack of appropriate legislation around payment terms gives freelancers little practical power to ensure terms are enforced - resulting in serious cash flow issues."
Consultation closed on 16 Sep 2015. Public and parliament have a legitimate expectation that the government will publish the detailed results before enacting associated legislation. To be credible any amendment to Sunday trading law must be strongly supported by the responses to the consultation.

The Secretary of State for Health would benefit from a direct understanding of what is expected of junior members of staff especially out-of-hours.  This experience on the front-line may inform policy making and contract negotiations with staff especially relating to working conditions.
The Recall of MPs Act 2015 is very limited in scope. It only covers when an MPs is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House for at least 21 sitting days.  It should be extended to allow for the recall of MPs that ignore the wishes of the majority of their constituents.

I believe that england doesn't see much snow and when it does the children in schools need time to appreciate it. Maybe they could dabble in winter sports or just have a simple snowball fight. It can als be dangerous to get children to school as the roads will become icy and dangerous for driving.
"£15ph National minimum wage for hgv drivers should be made compulsory.
It’s came to my attention that minimum wage has risen for UK workers but HGV drivers wages are still far too low.

Seeing that a full page was allowed to be advertising and encouraging the general public to seek legal advise after visiting a hospital is encouraging people to become more litigious. The NHS is seen as advising people to seek out ways to make money by claiming and they are in a position of trust.
Petitions are becoming the bane of our existence. Hardly a day passes without some irritant imploring us to support one in a vain attempt to get the Government to do something of very little consequence instead of spending precious parliamentary time on something of significance.
"If Team GB finish above China in the medals table, we should have a day's public holiday in the UK to celebrate this.

"Car tax system is ridiculous and too complex. The simple thing to do would be to add it to petrol. Everyone pays, even visitors in vehicles from abroad. The bigger/less efficient the engine the more petrol it would use and more tax is paid. Seems simple to me. Plus one less department to pay for."

Current funding of 30 free hours only covers term time which for most working parents only actually covers maybe a day and a half child care as like me most work full time meaning if you have more then 1 child costs soon add up.  get the government to change 30hours free a week not just in term

Traffic lights have been installed at number of recent new road schemes which continually disrupt the smooth flow of traffic in spite of the overwhelming evidence of the numerous existing junctions with uncontrolled roundabouts which keep traffic flowing smoothly.
So as the Metric system is a lot easier to convert lengths through I think we should convert our measurements to km/h while keeping the mph sign for old road users. I think we should add the km/h sign under the mph road sign with a different coloured ring (green maybe) and km/h after it.

If media agencies are going to quote the numbers of signatories as being indicative of public support then this website needs to do more to ensure that bots can't sign it. Using Google's free reCAPTCHA service would be a simple way of stripping out the vast majority of bots.
If Vote Leave has broken any laws regarding overspending in 2016 EU referendum then Art.50 should be immediately withdrawn and full EU membership continued.

"Change the law so that anyone found guilty of Killing another Human being, where their actions were solely to blame for someones death, a Mandatory Lifetime Ban should be part of the Sentencing Process."
"Two years ago the government voted to allow police to investigate All matters internally.

Instead of putting all cases, of police assualts against civilians or common law breaches, straight to the CPS, 

They now get a chance to cover up the matter or potentially 'falsify' the evidence."
Water meters have created a heavy burden on poorer families as bills have risen more than double since their introduction. There are many families who are hundreds of pounds in debt to the water companies and are being chased by debt companies. Water is a human right to have not a luxury.
"Too expensive to have monarch. Majority of the time monarch does not exercise powers. Feudal system outdated. Britain needs change to more modern and democratic society. 

"
"Anyone who claims benefits because they don't work, should be made to do a few hours of community service each day. I feel this would help as they are earning the money and giving back to the community, there is no reason for people to be getting money without working for it."
It would appear that too many young people between the ages of 18 and 25 are being persuaded about their political decisions by uneducated pop stars and celebrities. therefore only persons over 25 should have the political mandate.
"Our government is spending £10 million to turn a military plane into a private plane for David Cameron and Senior Ministers. They made damaging cuts in the name of austerity. They also tell us, we are all in it together. A private plane is not an example of us all being in it together."
"Ever since the early 1500's, the Romany population in the United Kingdom has been – through the varying Government legislation specifically aimed at “Egyptians” or “Gypsies” - severely and unfairly subjected to many human rights abuses that still cast a shadow on our community today .."
"Thousands of employees working for the government earn under the real living wage - currently £10.55 p/hour in London & £9.00 p/hour outside of London.

All workers deserve at least the living wage & the government should be leading by example ensuring that in-house & outsourced staff receive it."
At the moment for a single adult claimant of Universal Credit the law states we can live on £317.82 but can take 40% (£127) of this to pay off likes of budget loans or rent arrears etc leaving someone with very little to live on after bills & food
"Households in the UK produce 22 million tonnes of waste per year and only 44% is recycled. Our country keeps exporting our waste (particularly plastic) to other far shores. Since China have introduced a ban against this, the government are searching for new places to export."
"The recent e-collar ban is fundamentally flawed in still permitting use of electric containment systems which make similar use of the fear- and pain-based so-called ‘training aid’. 
‘Invisible fences’ inflict the same aversive stimulus on pets, scientifically proven to negatively affect welfare."
"The UK government has announced plans to trial asking voters to produce ID before being allowed to vote. If this law was to be passed then it will be unfairly affecting the poor, the marginalised, the homeless, the isolated and the most vulnerable sections of our society. It needs to be stopped."
"Newham Acute Day Hospital has helped 1000s of people with mental health problems who are in crisis.  The hospital is a vital, life-saving alternative to inpatient admission.  Let's take a stand against NHS cuts at a time when mental health problems are at epidemic levels in the United Kingdom."
"People living in Scotland,Wales,N Ireland,and even London,can get a free bus pass.I feel that it discriminates against people living in England."
Causes frustration to motorists leading to dangerous overtaking. Also puts cyclist at risk
Farmed animals can be kept in near darkness with no access to fresh air or natural light spending their whole lives in sheds that are little more than dungeons. The denial of natural light and fresh intensifies great suffering to intelligent and sentient life forms.
"Make it law holiday insurance companies can not be ageist and discriminate health issues by charging extortionate premiums. Once over 65 yrs of age premiums increase dramatically without just cause. Medical conditions pre or existing are charged regardless, as they may be cured or controlled etc."
"JIA affects every aspect of everyday life, most children with JIA have accompanying conditions & deal with pain everyday. DLA helps to help ease some of the everyday pressures faced as a family.With recent cuts DLA have been taken away even though no there has been no change in the child condition"
"The ticketing companies have no interest in selling all tickets at original face value as they will inflate their profits by selling them through their related businesses.
""Sold out"" tickets appear on resale sites within minutes of release for several times the face value."
"Current methods cause massive unnecessary slaughter of Bees. Bees are vital to our survival and to maintaining our delicate eco systems
Unnatural methods used by industrial beekeepers, such as A.I, antibiotics, clipping a Queen Bee's wings are wholly unacceptable
All to satisfy corporate greed"
After going through a massive gambling problem myself I believe the UK is still failing to protect problem gamblers. I believe if you are self excluded from one company this should exclude you from all companies as there's way too many and you can just open another account.
"The rental market is open to abuse by letting agents who can name their price; there is no correlation between the costs they incur and the fees charged. It's a free for all, with fees for the same processes widely differing for no apparent reason but to put more money in the pocket of the agent."
"Caring, in our life time we will all require a need for caring, either for ourselves or for a person close to us. Carers need to work on Person-Centred Care principals via the Care Support Plan.  "
"It is only fair that current/new students get the fulfilment of their university course they pay for (£9,000 a year), by providing free set text books for each course they are on."
"The recent IPCC report on climate change, suggests that the process of climate change is accelerating, will have more dramatic effects and is more limited by time . This is grounds to amend the target or baseline year from 2050 to 2035 as outlined in the Climate Change Act; Section 2; Subsection 2."
"Consumer request to regulate over-charging in 24 month bundled contracts, ensuring clearer, transparent pricing for both the phone and the tariff in the contract, ensuring customers can get access to their data consumption and aren’t overcharged for data they don’t need, or overpay for the phone."
"In September of this year my partner Claire died due to long term alcohol dependancy, more or less my last words to Claire was that I was going to try and help others in the same situation. 

Being alcohol dependant doesn't just effect the person it also effects close family and friends"
"Since Theresa May took office, senior Conservative MPs and ministers - including the Foreign Secretary - have advocated for a new royal yacht to be purchased. We believe this would be a waste of taxpayers' money, and that the government should focus on more important issues facing the UK."
There have been calls for a public inquiry to the collapse of Monarch airlines and maybe look into changing the law on pensions so when a company goes into administration money can be put aside for the pension fund.
"As the obesity rate increases within the United Kingdom, it is for the better if there was a ""fat tax"".

How it could work:
- Fatty foods get taxed more, and so we use that money to subsidize healthier food.

For example:
- A burger costs £2 a piece while veg and healthy meat is almost free."
"There is no law in the UK that bans the testing of cleaning products on animals. This is a cruel practice with no practical use whatsoever. I urge you to please sign this petition if you , like me love animals and do not want to see them suffer."
"Homes are for living in, they are not pension pots. Prices are now ridiculous, driven up by greedy investors. Politicians fear losing elections if house prices fall, yet high prices do not even benefit them either.
Bring down house prices now!"
"When voting during a General Election, it is likely voters base their decision not only on who they want to represent them locally, but also who they would like to represent the country on the global stage. If the PM resigns, the public should get to vote again based on the new leadership."
The government should be checking and making sure landlords aren't charging extortionate money to student tenants. Introducing a cap on rent for students in shared households and halls of residence means students wouldn't be struggling to make attempt to cover the missing finances.
"The government must do more ensure approximately 237,000 carers receive National Insurance (NI) credits to their state pension. It's estimated that as many as 95% of the 250,000 carers who could get Carer's Credits are not receiving them. They may retire on a lower state pension as a result."
"The U.K. Government gave assurances during the Windrush scandal that Commonwealth immigrants will be treated fairly and their right of abode will be respected. This must be extended to those who have lived here most of their lives and for whom deportation means returning to an unknown country.

"
"The only slogan on the side of the Leave EU campaign bus stated in large letters that if we left the EU, £350m per week could go to the NHS. The government has now stated that this will not happen so the reason thousands voted for Brexit and the democratic will of the people has been ignored."
"The current arrangements reduce the incentive for students to achieve high-earning roles. Successful students see their debt increase every year until they are earning 4 x the average salary. 
Lower earners may never repay anything. This situation cannot be justified."
I am 58 years old. Working with all sorts of conditions: COPD; Glucoma; 2 bad discs; Arthritis. To try and get time off to see a doctor is almost impossible. Getting up is a struggle. But I am not entitled to disability as I can dress wash and feed myself. Everyday is a struggle.
"action to promote consistent and proactive approach to career  coaching in schools /colleges. 
Each student to receive a career coaching programme to suit.
Mock interviews depends who is ""interviewing"". coaches should be paid for their skills and talents."
First past the post system is out of date and unfair. This system no longer represents the nature of modern political opinion
I have seen how things are run in my mother's care home and we are neglecting these vulnerable people. There are not enough staff for the care and well being of the residents. I am one of very few relatives who visit regularly. After all most of us will end up in this situation.
"""Joint Enterprise"" is putting innocent people in jail from anywhere between 6months and life, if you go in a takeaway and come out with chips but you robbed it and i drove away with you in the car, then im equally as ""Joint"" to the crime as the person who robbed the store."
I'd like to propose the reopening of Hambleton Village Station (closed in 1959) due to massive population expansion with the nearest alternative stations being Selby and South Milford. These trains pass the old station platform anyway and could easily stop to collect!
"The U.K. is demonstrating a hostile feeling towards all immigrants.And now we are a population that feel openly ostracised,voiceless,discriminated against and unwelcome. We need clear evidence that we are wanted and welcome in this country and proof that we are an integral part of the U.K.'s future."
"In times of equality and social integration, it is wrong to exempt the slaughter practises of Halal and Kosher from the Animal Welare Act."
Yoga and meditation for children offers a unique possibility for every child to experience a joyful blossoming of his or her potential.  Simple practices of yoga and meditation enhance a child's ability to learn. Doing yoga children connect more deeply within and to the natural world around them.
Make all establishments selling halal food advertise the fact prominently. This must be done with clearly displayed signs in English & another locally prominent language e.g. Polish. This includes their websites and any printed advertising. These establishment must have  transparent sales policies.
"the new provision to allow new part time students eligible for a maintenance portion of student finance, is unfair to legacy & distance learners, currently if you are a part time distance learning student you do not qualify for the maintenance loan unless you have a disability & are a new student"
"With the rise in medical insurance premiums through medical inflation and subscribers becoming older, there is currently a year-on-year decrease of 40,000 people insured. Putting premiums up even further (the IPT increase) will send more folk into an already overstretched NHS and makes no sense."
"While the last review left the Daily Food Charge set at £4.79, from October the 1st the cost of a core meal at a Pay As You Dine facility will increase to £5.75 to account for VAT at the 20% rate.

No VAT should be paid on core meal provisions or proper cooking facilities should be provided."
"Some Survivors of sexual violence and rape who suffer chronic PTSD and other trauma symptoms, can often find it impossible to engage in the criminal justice process. This means that criminal cases aren't instigated and perpetrators are free to continue committing crimes."
"The NHS promotes breastfeeding as it gives you and your baby the best chance of being healthy. However, when/if you have any problems they don't have the support available to help you continue breastfeeding. The breast clinics in hospitals don't even have breastfeeding experts. This needs to change!"
Carnival fish are often kept in poor conditions in small bags. These bags become very hot on warm days and will run out of oxygen. They're given without any advice on how to care for them. Goldfish live on average 5-10 years in captivity however carnival fish often die shortly after being given.
"As rising costs continue to soar for ill animals (pets), dogs and cats. The medication they need to ease their pain continues to soar. Humans can get free prescriptions, so why not for our animals?? They are a conscious living being with a soul same as us."
"As of September, 3,859 prisoners were still in custody after being sentenced to an IPP and more than 8/10 were beyond the expiry date of the original sentence. IPP was scrapped in 2012. What they have served is disproportionate to the crimes they have committed."
"As a country we should enforce ALL places where food is handled to display their food hygiene rating. Food hygiene is crucial and diseases and infections can occur from ""poor hygiene"" - we as paying customers have the right to know how hygienic our food is respectively."
Supposedly put on more trains but have halved them instead. Seats removed. All having to leave extra early and getting home a lot later.
"Having served for 19yrs 216 days and completed 10 Operational tours i found myself being placed on the scrapheap once diagnosed with PTSD. Without charities stepping in to help us, we have nothing in support. We need the Government to invest in us, it would mean that Politicians actually care!!"
"Recent use of pellet guns on Kashmiri protestors has caused blindness of more than 150 people mostly children and 60 deaths.
Kashmir is under curfew and serious restrictions imposed on normal daily life for 45 days.
Indian refuses to initiate a dialogue"
"There is a petition stating that the NHS should not pay for abortions, and I was shocked and appalled by this stance. 

Being pro-choice is the understanding that each person deserves full body autonomy and no religious, governmental, or personal opinion should impact that freedom for individuals."
"At Orgreave, South Yorkshire Police ordered officers to charge ""a largely peaceful crowd"" & evidence given by South Yorkshire Police (SYP) has been described as ""the biggest frame-up ever"", SYP had a culture of fabricating evidence, which was not corrected by the time of the Hillsborough disaster."
It's unfair that young people have to pay such extortionate rents & may never own their own homes.  They are paying incredibly high rents with no security and this has to be re-balanced.  If they have been proven to pay rent &  have good credit history they should be able to own their own home
"Energy drinks are full of caffeine and other ingredients that can lead to serious health issues. I, along with many other people, feel that all energy drinks should be sold under the age restriction law. I feel that the ingredients in energy drinks are not suitable for children younger than 16 years"
Cleveland police have investigated child sexual abuse and exploitation with little result. I believe many more people should have been charged and many people were too scared to come forward. The impact of this has devastated many people and even led to drug and alcohol problems.
"Corrosive liquids can be bought easily in DIY stores or online and disguised in drinks bottles. In law, a stabbing is an attempted murder, while an acid attack is only GBH. There's no specific offence regarding acid attacks, even though the impact on the victim can be far worse than a stabbing."
"The North East of England has the highest proportion of eating disorders, yet it has little to no support for treatment. Recently the NHS pulled funding on the REDS outpatient department for eating disorders in Newcastle so vulnerable adults now cannot receive community support."
"In a country which professes to be a nation of animal lovers, pet owners looking for houses to rent are being forced to give up their animals in order to find somewhere to live.  Estate agents do not earn their expensive fees by trying to negotiate for pets. This situation is completely unfair."
"Following an incident that could have caused serious injury or even death to one of my children due to a bus driver driving the bus with doors open, I move to have equipment legally required on buses that stops the bus from moving while doors are open."
Due to errors made by child and/or working tax credits. People are being forced to pay back any money thats apparently owed and struggling. Its their error so why should we pay it back if its not our fault. They need to better the system.
"The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."
"After the collapsing of the devolved government in Northern Ireland, it is so important that young people are able to have a say. Yet those who are under 18 still have no voice in our future. 16 year olds were allowed to vote in the Scottish Referendum, so why not the youth of Northern Ireland?"
"Products like weight loss teas, meal replacements and other supplements are currently being sold by multi-level marketing distributors who aren't required to have any formal training in nutrition. They are giving advice that they aren't qualified to give and this is dangerous to the general public."
"Student loans charge a huge 6.1% interest, even during study. Worse, the 6.1% is compounded monthly, meaning interest is added to the loans every month, making loans bigger, so the next month the interest costs even more; the loans get bigger and interest costs increase every month. It is a rip-off."
Based on the realization that significantly misleading and inaccurate misinformation and untruths have been officially used and admitted to influence the EU referendum. We demand the first referendum be declared void and a second and final referendum be held considering the following:-
"John Bowlby started his research in the 1960's - importance of a primary bond to a main person. He discovered that this role was vital in for survival, not only through infancy but long into adulthood. I struggle to understand in the 2018, this information is still not taught in antenatal classes."
Make it compulsory for all Police Officers to carry a Taser gun by 2020 to protect Police Officers and the public.
"In Leeds & York there has been a constant flow of deaths due to people falling in to the rivers when consuming alcohol, more pressure needs to be placed on councils to protect its people from accidental falls in to rivers where the sale of alcohol has been granted"
"Tyler, The Creator claims he has been banned from the UK.
The US rapper says he is not allowed to enter the country for ""three to five years"" because of lyrics he wrote in 2009.
The co-founder of hip-hop collective Odd Future has always attracted controversy."
"Due to recent media pressure, stores are now asking for ID for energy drinks. Energy drinks are a legal product, and most stores don't have the manpower or staffing availability to quickly serve their customers.
This behaviour should be stopped, driven as it is by a vocal segment of the population."
The decision to leave the European Union will have huge consequences for the United Kingdom. The economic tests that were created to assess readiness for EMU provide a model for taking proper account of the economic consequences prior to notifying the EU of our intention to leave under Article 50.
"The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.  Whilst Parliament is prevaricating over whether to respect the outcome of the referendum,  it is surely time for the symbols of EU rule to be removed from our country.  ."
"I want licensed gun owners to able own pistols as I find it strange how the government allows for the use of shotguns and hunting rifles, however, neglects the use of a smaller, less powerful, and  considerably cheaper firearm to purchase in comparison to a shotgun that can be very expensive"
The Panavia  tornado has been flying for many years for the golf war and has saved many lives so at least we can do is give a preservation of flying order to it this means to keep it in flying so it won't be scrapped and forgot we have done the same for ww2 aircraft let's do it for the future
"Working nights comes with its heightened health risks. Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lower life expectancy etc. Jet lag is certain. Working nights disorientated, whether it's physically demanding or operating machinery is a risk to health and safety. Please keep night workers healthy and safe"
"Research has found families in Leeds have insufficient support following the sudden death of a child. The bereavement support study, commissioned by Leeds charity Elliot’s Footprint, identified that the current level of support is ineffective, leaving bereaved parents struggling and grieving alone."
"The House of Lords is an unelected body of career appointees. It serves the people worse than did the Hereditary Peers, under the Bill of Rights and the Parliament Act of 1911 The Lords must effectively balance the Commons (which increasingly does not serve the People); a PR HoL will do so."
There are too many people who are being abused in their home and we need to make people including young children who may be victims of it aware of the signs so they can go for help if they need to. It will help reduce the amount of deaths each year which go unnoticed.
"The £3.5bn extra in England by 2020, not enough.  Similar amount  cut from SC budgets since 2010.  Extra would not solve the longer term problems of caring for a population which is continuing to age.

NHS England funding crisis deepens, with trusts forecasting a £2.3bn deficit by end of the FY."
"The UK wealth gap is widening and child poverty is increasing.  Yet the UK has seen a boom in the number of high-net-worth individuals.

To show commitment for creating a fairer society, the government must start by investigating the use of offshore tax havens."
My little boy 4yrs old has a little tail at the back of his head he has had this style since having hair and school is telling me he has to cut it off after a year of being there its his identity shouldn't matter what his hair is like
"15-17 year olds are charged 'adult' train fares by travel companies across the UK, despite being legally classified as minors. We are paid less than over 18s for doing exactly the same jobs, yet are expected to pay the same ludicrous travel fares. Regulations should be put in place to prevent this."
Going to court is hugely in favour of the party with the biggest financial clout. They can afford to risk legal costs that the smaller party can't. The smaller party has no control over the larger parties cost yet may have to pay them. There is no other business where you can't control your costs.
"Mainland Denmark is in the EU, whilst devolved Greenland and Faroe Islands are in Denmark but not in the EU. Great Britain and Northern Ireland are in the UK and therefore the EU, while the Isles of Jersey, Guernsey and Man are in the British Isles but not in the UK or the EU."
EU citizens who were not eligible to vote in the Brexit referendum are being charged £65 to apply to stay in the UK. This is manifestly unjust. As a bare minimum we should recognise the contribution of our friends & neighbours by offering income tax relief on these fees.
"The current laws regarding 'Settlement Agreements' or 'Without Prejudice Conversations' or 'Protected Conversations' or 'Off the record Conversations' are shockingly lacking in safeguards for the employee.

They can be sprung upon an employee as a way of getting rid of them without red tape."
"There has been many cases of people urinating and damaging war memorials and they have been charged with Out Raging Public Decency.
The full weight of the law must be brought down on people that do this with a prison sentence,Memorials to those that gave there live`s for us must be protected"
"We call on HMG to aim for a practical workable realistic outcome in negotiations with the EU. To that end, rejoining EFTA & remaining in the EEA is the only sensible initial route. Any other approach will waste time, to the detriment of us all."
Hundreds of thousands of endangered animals in Africa are being poached every year throughout the continent. Many of the countries where this poaching is most common are very limited on resources that is needed to protect these animals. The British military would have the resources to make a impact.
Some schools will suffer £1000's in cuts over the next 3 years under the NFF. The Government should reconsider the introduction of the National Funding Formula and commit to provide additional funding to schools in more deprived areas without cutting funding to schools already struggling.

"There are 826 Members of the House of Lords the average daily attendance is around 483, the net operating costs for the chamber totalled 94.4 million four 2014/2015, of this 20.7 million was spent on members allowances and expenses. Surely this should be put to a referendum of the people."
"You may be surprised to learn that how much we pay to fill up our cars vans and trucks isn’t regulated at all.  And having no government watchdog or independent pricing body means that how, when and why forecourt prices rise and fall is a closely guarded secret. We think that’s wrong."
The sentences that pedophiles and child abusers  get given is a joke. They ruin peoples life's . The child and the family of the children get given a life sentence. Its a joke to think that someone can violate a child in the worse way possible and get just a slap on the wrist and think nothing of it
"The House of Lords conducted an inquiry into the amount of food wasted in EU and from that inquiry, it emerged that a staggering 200m tonnes of food is wasted by Asda, Co-operative Food, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose.

Let us make it a criminal offence to waste food."
"The Conservative election manifesto said that expensive council houses will be ""sold off and replaced as they fall vacant"".   More detail below.

Sadly, this clear commitment to replace council houses sold is not in the Housing Bill."
"FACT - The majority of motorists do not stick to speed limits as they are outdated and unrealistic. I urge the government to survey a single carriageway and review the results. As opposed to penalising motorists, perhaps we could plagiarise a leaf out of Germany's law and introduce a limitless zone?"
"Increasing the sale age to 21 would decrease the use of tobacco nationwide. 

But ultimately the main goal is to be the first country to ban the sale altogether."
This year many trains have been cancelled by this company outside of industrial action. The company have cited staff shortages. But this is happening every day of every week. Surely their planning &/or HR department should & could have seen this coming.
"As Alex Salmond stated in 2014, time and time again, “this independence vote is a once in a generation vote.” Yet, come 2016, the SNP are at it again, striving to gain independence from this UK. As a generation equates to 32 years, let us make sure that they cannot seek indyref2 until at least 2046."

"Our collective CO2 emissions are just those of each individual added together: each of us can and must limit our carbon footprint. As well as strong legislative action, the government should contact every home to explain the reality and danger of climate change and advise what each of us should do."
"While enjoying a family holiday at a campsite in Brittany, France, a circus arrived to set up their show. 
We were horrified to see two lions and two tigers (one an albino) locked in tiny cages on the back of a lorry. 
Surely it is time to ban live animal acts across Europe?"
"The British government is contracting EDF France and The People's Republic of China to build 3 Nucleur Reactors. They will each cost a minimum of £24bn. 

If this was spent on renewable R&D and projects we will not need nucleur power stations nor fracking and we will have clean energy."
"There is  need to ensure the UK has access to the European single market without suffering tariffs.

I believe tariffs will lead to job losses in automotive, aerospace and other manufacturing industries."

We ask you to sign to have GCSE ICT reinstated"
I believe that large scale offices need to have a green impact to this country and i don't just mean money wise. In large offices i know there is a lot of waste that gets sent to harmful landfills which could easily be recycled. We have only one planet.
"I am disabled due to a stroke and receive housing Benefits to top up the wage I earn.  Letting agents are allowed to discriminate against this, regardless of circumstance. It harks back to the time when people were allowed to discriminate against skin colour and nationality."
"Currently innocent children unaware of their legal rights can be secretly detained and questioned by the police and social workers at their school without parents. Any questioning by the police should be done at a police station in the presence of a legal representative for the child, not at school."
"Dogs & Domestic Animals are bred & kept alone on allotments in conditions in contravention of the 5 Freedoms of the Animal Welfare Act.

"Who has had enough of being left with the repair costs, when involved in an accident with a push bike? 
Personally I am sick of being left at the roadside after a bike has hit my vehicle and then fled the scene."
Many people were affected by the floods and polling stations so were unable to vote. Reopen voting to allow these people to vote.
"Further action must be brought in for owners, in order to prevent flippant animal purchases and irresponsible, unlicensed breeding. Sadly, charities are overflowing with pets; not enough responsibility is being taken by the owner- microchips just aren't enough, especially when details are outdated."
"With such massive change at stake, with the potential for unlimited costs, can you justify such change without mandate? There is clearly large support for allowing more migrants, from those in society who are notoriously more vocal with their issues, there is also a silent and growing voice against."
"The ""7 day week"" proposals would stretch the already stretched resources and people of the NHS well past breaking point, and do Not provide the funding and staff required. The petition to have Mr Hunt removed was brushed aside, can we at least agree his policies need removing?"
The roads around the area are becoming blocked with traffic. There is one main road in and out and when this has any work done to it the town grinds to a halt. The secondary road had recently collapsed and has caused a huge demand on an already overloaded road.
"Steroid-dependant patients need an exemption from paying for dental treatment. Addison’s disease sufferers are steroid dependant, which damages teeth and bones. We have no choice, it is just like a diabetic needing insulin, yet we have to pay dental costs and they don't."
"We used to set speed limits scientifically and sensibly instead of on a totally arbitrary, Nimbyist, green political, subjective basis that we use now. In those days the strap line 'It's a limit for a reason' did have some merit. Now such claims are totally false."
"Being a metal detectorist my friends and I find so many beautiful ancient coins that have stood up to being buried for centuries.  The coins we have now would have all rotted away of a similar period, let's honour our Queen by minting a few nice silver coins."
